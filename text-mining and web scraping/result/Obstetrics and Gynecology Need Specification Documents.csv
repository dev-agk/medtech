These	 unmet	 clinical	 needs	 were	 identified	 following	 an	 8-week	 clinical	 immersion	 that	 was	
conducted	 by	 a	 team	 in	 Obstetrics	 and	 Gynecology.	 The	 clinical	 immersion	 was	 conducted	 in	
high	 volume	 tertiary	 care	 centres	 in	 South	 India.	 We	 observed	 what’s	 done	 and	 how	 it	 affects	
the	 provider,	 the	 patient,	 and	 the	 system.	 This	 was	 followed	 by	 a	 peripheral	 immersion	 to	
numerous	 primary,	 secondary	 and	 tertiary	 health	 care	 centres	 across	 India.	 The	 clinical	 needs	
found	 in	 the	 tertiary	 care	 hospital	 were	 validated	 in	 other	 large	 centres	 and	 new	 primary	 and	
secondary	 specific	 unmet	 needs	 were	 added	 on.	 At	 the	 end	 of	 2	 months	 of	 clinical	 immersion,	
the	team	had	over	100	detailed	observations	with	significant	negative	outcomes	and	150	unmet	
clinical	needs.	These	needs	were	then	filtered	using	objective	parameters,	detailed	below:

observers	 and	 clinicians)	 as	 well	 as	 the	 epidemiology	 of	 the	 disease	 and	 the	 frequency	 of	 the	
negative	 outcome.	 This	 data	 was	 then	 validated	 by	 a	 comprehensive

Fetal	Distress	 (FD)	 is	 a	 complication	 of	 labor.	 It	 occurs	when	 the	 fetus	 does	 not	 receive	 enough	
oxygen.	Fetal	distress	may	also	occur	when	the	pregnancy	lasts	too	long	(post	maturity).	
Usually,	 doctors	 identify	 fetal	 distress	 based	 on	 an	 abnormal	 fetal	 heart	 rate	 pattern.	 In	 such	
cases,	 the	 fetus’	heart	 rate	 is	monitored	continuously.	 It	 is	usually	monitored	continuously	with	
electronic	 fetal	 heart	 monitoring	 or,	 a	 hand-held	 Doppler	 ultrasound	 device	 may	 be	 used	 to	
check	 the	heart	 rate	 every	15	minutes	during	 early	 labor	 and	 after	 each	 contraction	during	 late	
labor.	[1]
