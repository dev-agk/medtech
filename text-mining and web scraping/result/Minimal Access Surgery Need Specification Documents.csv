FILTERING PARAMETERS  

The AIM (Affordable Inventions in Medical Technology) Fellowship Program 

The Affordable Inventions in Medical Technology (AIM) Fellowship conducted by The Lemelson 

Foundation and InnAccel is focused on the creation and publication of a robust database of 

validated clinical needs within 

the 

Indian healthcare system based on hours of clinical 

immersion and extensive secondary research. In essence, it is meant to provide entrepreneurs, 

engineers, designers and others inclined toward healthcare innovation, with a solid foundation 

to build on as they create solutions to bridge key gaps and address specific unmet needs. 

The Methodology: Following the Stanford BioDesign Process 

The core essence of the BioDesign Process is the clinical immersion of multidisciplinary teams, 

to investigate and validate unmet clinical needs, identify gaps and opportunities in the need 

area, ideate and systematically select a lead concept to address the need, and determine its 

feasibility through prototyping and proof of concept testing. It consists of 3 phases Identify, 

Invent and Implement. Of these 3, this Fellowship was focussed only on the first. 

The identify phase is, first and foremost, the search for important unmet health needs. By 

directly observing the full cycle of care from diagnosis and treatment to recovery and billing, we 

explore problems and opportunities and ask pointed questions that challenge the status quo. 

During this first-hand observation period, 

it’s 

ideal to collect hundreds of needs, without 

judging or prioritizing. This is followed by filtering the list with rigorous objectivity. This 

intense and iterative process involves exploring epidemiology, criticality, technical complexity, 

competitor analysis and regulatory obstacles. Ultimately we narrowed down to 10 needs in each 

therapy area, which if solved would have a major impact on health and wellness. 

This document details the 3 levels of filtering used during the AIM Fellowship to prioritise the 

top unmet needs

Level 1: The level 1 filter eliminated those needs which are redundant, pharmaceutical related 

or process related.  

Level 2: This level of filtering focused on the severity of clinical condition (in the perception of 

observers and clinicians) as well as the epidemiology of the disease and the frequency of the 

negative outcome. This data was then validated by a comprehensive 

literature review of 

incidence and prevalence data. A scoring system of 1 – 3 – 5 was used through the process.

The skin is a natural barrier against infection. Even with many precautions and protocols to 

prevent infection in place, any surgery that causes a break in the skin can lead to an infection. 

Surgeons call these infections surgical site infections (SSIs) because they occur on the part of 

the body where the surgery took place.1 If you have surgery in India, the chances of developing 

an SSI are about 4.2%.2 An SSI typically occurs within 30 days after surgery. The CDC describes 

3 types of surgical site infections: Superficial incisional SSI, Deep incisional SSI, Organ or space 

SSI. Any SSI may cause redness, delayed healing, fever, pain, tenderness, warmth, or swelling 

plus some specific symptoms based on the classification above. Infections after surgery are 

caused 

by 

certain 

microbial 

agents. 

The 

most 

common 

of 

these 

include 

the 

bacteria Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Pseudomonas. These bacteria can infect a surgical 

wound through various forms of contact, such as from the touch of a contaminated caregiver or 

surgical instrument, through germs in the air, or through germs that are already on or in your 

body and then spread into the wound. The degree of risk for an SSI is linked to the type of 

surgical wound you have. Surgical wounds can be classified in this way: Clean wounds, Clean-

contaminated wounds, contaminated wounds, dirty wounds. These are other risk factors for 

SSIs such as surgery that lasts more than 2 hours, other medical problems or diseases, elderly 

patients, obesity, smoking, cancer, lowered immunity, diabetes, emergency surgery and certain 

specific surgeries such as abdominal surgeries. It is difficult to ignore the burden posed by 

surgical site infections (SSIs) on patients' safety in terms of pain, suffering, delayed wound 

healing, increased use of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance, revision surgery, increased length 

of hospital stay, mortality, morbidity and excess healthcare costs. SSIs have also been associated 

with the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria

A 25-year-old woman G3P2L2A1 underwent 

a 

laparoscopic 

vaginal hysterectomy 

for 

symptomatic fibroids in a tertiary health center.  The patient was put in the lithotomy position, 

the abdomen was prepped and draped. 

 A peri-umbilical 

incision was used to 

introduce 

pneumoperitoneum. A larger 10-12 mm trocar was placed above the umbilicus to provide a 

panoramic view of 

the pelvis. An 8-mm 

trocar was 

inserted 

in 

the 

lower quadrants, 

approximately 2-3 cm superior and 2-3 cm medial to the anterior superior iliac spine. In a 

bilateral fashion, the round ligaments were identified, grasped, and divided with bipolar or 

monopolar cautery, developing both the anterior and posterior leaf of the broad ligament. After 

ureteral identification, further retroperitoneal dissection allowed the ureter to fall laterally and 

away from active ligation and coagulation. A window was developed in the medial leaf of the 

broad 

ligament and 

the 

infundibulopelvic 

ligaments were 

sealed with 

suture, bipolar 

electrocautery, or surgical clips. Once the anterior and posterior colpotomies were opened, the 

uterine vessels were skeletonized, sealed, and divided with a sealing device or vessel clips. The 

remainder of the colpotomy was completed using monopolar or bipolar cautery. After the 

division of the uterus and cervix from the upper vagina, the specimens were then delivered 

through the vagina. The vaginal cuff was then closed with interrupted sutures. The patient was 

extubated and shifted to the post-operative room for monitoring and then to the ward. On 

postoperative day 3 she presented with fever, abdominal pain, and purulent vaginal discharge 

and was diagnosed with vaginal cuff infection post hysterectomy. She was re-admitted and 

started on IV antibiotics and had an abscess drainage in the hospital for an additional week 

before being discharged.

Most SSIs are believed to be acquired during surgery. This is supported by the success of SSI 

prevention measures directed towards activities in the operating theater and a few reports 

demonstrating matching strains of pathogens from the surgeon's fingers and postoperative 

infection. However, despite much research on SSI, there are currently no data on the actual 

proportion acquired in the operating theater versus post-operative care in the wards. Similarly, 

within the subgroup of SSIs acquired during surgery, the proportion originating from the 

patient versus that transmitted by the surgical staff, operating theatre procedure or the 

environment remains unknown.3 The risk of complications is poorly characterized in many 

parts of the world, but studies in industrialized countries have shown a perioperative rate of 

death 

from 

inpatient surgery of 0.4 to 0.8% and a rate of major complications of 3 to 

17%. These rates are likely to be much higher in developing countries. Thus, surgical care and 

its attendant complications represent a substantial burden of disease worthy of attention from 

the public health community worldwide. Data suggest 

that at 

least half of all surgical 

complications are avoidable. SSIs remain a significant clinical problem as they are associated 

with substantial mortality and morbidity and impose severe demands on healthcare resources. 

The incidence of SSIs may be as high as 20%, depending on the surgical procedure, the 

surveillance criteria used, and the quality of data collection. 4, 5 Resultant increased hospital stay 

due to surgical site infection (SSI) has been estimated at 7-10 days, increasing hospitalization 

costs by 20%. 6

Epidemiology: As per the ‘Surgical site infection rates in 6 cities of India: Findings of the 

International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC)', the SSI rates in India were: 

4.3% for coronary bypass with chest and donor incision, 8.3% for breast surgery, 6.5% for 

cardiac surgery and 6.0% for exploratory abdominal surgery. 2 

Although the exact number of surgeries conducted in India is not available, a WHO report stated

SSI precautions: The 

importance of peri-operative precautions have been established 

in 

various clinical trials and guidelines. 

CURRENT METHODS OF S S I PREVENT ION 1 

At present, four preventive measures are considered as having a high level of evidence (grade 

IA) according to major evidence-based guidelines: 3 

 

 

 

 

Surgical hand preparation 

Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis 

Postponing of an elective operation in the case of active remote infection 

Hair clipping: Pre-surgery hair clipping was considered grade IA evidence in the 1999 CDC 

guidelines this high grading is now a matter of debate. 

Other measures of high efficacy include:3 

 

Surgical expertise: An excellent surgical technique is believed to reduce SSI by maintaining 

effective hemostasis while preserving adequate blood supply; gentle handling of tissue; 

removal of devitalized tissue; eradication of dead space; and appropriate management of 

the postoperative incision 

 

Active Surveillance: Decreases in SSI rates have been observed in national surveillance 

networks in countries, such as France, Germany, and The Netherlands. An active surveillance 

programme may decrease SSI rates by merely reporting data without any other formal 

interventions 

 

Multi-Modal interventions: Surgical checklists, quality care initiatives etc.  

Widespread measures with low evidence: 3 

 Wound closure: Staples versus sutures are a hotly contested topic both are reported to be 

similar in terms of SSI risk. Some studies concluded that primary closure in dirty abdominal 

surgery leads to less SSIs than delayed primary closure, whereas others report the opposite. 



be a new approach 

to reduce wound contamination, but

Gloves & Adhesive Drapes: Sterile gloves and adhesive drapes are almost always used in 

the operating theater. They contribute to preventing site contamination and blood-borne

transmission 

from patients 

to surgeons. However, many gloves reveal 

tiny 

punctures after use that mostly go unnoticed and may double the SSI risk. Double-gloving or 

glove-changing might 

reduce 

the 

risk of punctures. A Cochrane 

review of 26 

trials 

conducted on the practice of double gloving as a barrier precaution was inconclusive in 

terms of SSI reduction. 

 

Laminar Airflow in the Operating Theater; A retrospective analysis in Germany showed 

no reduction of SSI with 

laminar airflow versus no 

laminar airflow but needs to be 

corroborated with larger scale studies.  

 

Oral Mechanical & Antibiotic Bowel Preparation: A meta-analysis including 14 trials and 

4859 patients failed to demonstrate a benefit of mechanical bowel preparation be fore 

colorectal surgery in terms of reduction of SSI or anastomotic leakage. The NICE guidelines 

do not recommend mechanical bowel preparation either.  

 

Postsurgical Wound Care: There is a paucity of literature on surgical wound care and SSI 

prevention. A Cochrane review assessed the effectiveness of various dressings and topical 

agents on surgical wound healing (and infection) and concluded that the quality of the trials 

was insufficient to determine any superiority of one protocol or one topical agent over 

another. Other randomized studies comparing occlusive versus gauze dressings equally 

failed to detect superiority in terms of SSI reduction or wound healing.

Antibiotics: Initial administration of empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy until the

is obtained. Antibiotics with coverage against gram-positive and gram-negative 

organisms, including Pseudomonas, should be empirically started and then tailored according to 

susceptibility pattern of isolated organisms. Duration of therapy depends on several factors, 

including 

isolated pathogen, 

retention of a 

catheter, or 

the presence of 

complications 

(endocarditis, sepsis). For most bacterial organisms, the duration of therapy is 10-14 days after 

blood cultures become negative. 

Surgical intervention: In cases such as abscesses, fistulas etc. antibiotics may not be sufficient 

to abate the infection and surgical intervention is needed as well.

Wound Protectors: Wound protectors are devices designed to protect the abdominal wound 

edges 

from contamination and 

trauma during 

laparotomy. They 

fall 

into 2 main design 

categories: those with an internal and external ring connected by impervious plastic and those 

with a single, internal ring connected to a drape that extends outward, over the wound edges 

and onto the abdomen where they are affixed with adhesive or clips. The reduction of SSI 

afforded by wound protectors is supported by several studies. However, other studies have 

obtained null results.  7

BA C K GROUN D 

Chronic sinusitis is one of the more prevalent chronic illnesses across the globe, affecting 

persons of all age groups. It is an inflammatory process that involves the paranasal sinuses and 

persists for 12 weeks or longer. The literature has supported that chronic sinusitis is almost 

always accompanied by concurrent nasal airway inflammation and is often preceded by rhinitis 

symptoms; thus, the term chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has evolved to more accurately describe 

this condition. The overall prevalence of CRS in the has been said to occur in 1 in 7 individuals 

and for unknown reasons, the incidence of this disease appears to be increasing yearly. In the 

USA alone this results in approximately 18-22 million physician visits and a direct treatment 

cost of $3.4-5 billion annually.1  

The first line of management for CRS is medical including antibiotics, anti -allergic drugs, nasal 

sprays etc. If the medical approach doesn't suffice, Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) 

is the most appropriate surgical procedure for sinus pathology treatment. Over the last decade, 

the procedure developed 

to relatively safe. The overall 

incidence of minor and major 

complication after FESS is range from 0.4% to 30%. The anatomy proximity of the paranasal 

sinuses to the orbits exposes it is to the risk of trauma. The majority of orbital complications are 

minor ones (3.9–20.24%). The major complications are seen in 0.01–2.25%, but some of them 

could be serious, leading to permanent dysfunction and loss of vision. 2 

The ophthalmic complications could be classified as minor (grade I) included injury to the 

lamina papyracea, major (grade II) injury to the lacrimal duct and finally serious (grade III) as 

retroorbital hemorrhage, injury to the optic nerve or any reduction of vision or blindness and 

injury of orbital muscle. As the minor and major ophthalmic complications are normally without 

any permanent disabilities the serious ones are potentially harmful. 2 

O B S E R V A T I ON 

A 42-year-old male was diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis (Bilateral frontals, maxillaries, 

and ethmoids) due to allergic hypersensitivity.  Medical management was attempted and failed 

and he was scheduled to undergo FESS. The patient's nasal cavities were decongested following 

which the surgeon performed an uneventful procedure with endoscopic uncinectomy, maxillary 

antrostomy, ethmoidectomy and frontal sinus clearance. A day post-endoscopic sinus surgery 

he complained of a loss of visual acuity in the left eye. Immediately after surgery, no deficits in 

ocular motility were observed, but the left eye had no light perception. Acetazolamide IV and 

dexamethasone IV were given but his vision did not recover. The orbital CT revealed a 

hematoma around the left medial rectus muscle and a possible partial defect in the lef t optic 

nerve. The fundoscopic examination did not reveal any abnormalities. A visual evoked potential 

(VEP) test revealed an absence of left optic nerve activity. Orbital MRI showed resolution of the 

hematoma 

surrounding 

the 

left medial 

rectus muscle. The patient was 

treated with 

prednisolone orally for 10 days and then discharged. Orbital MRI was performed 2 months after

persisting fat line loss and a continued contrast enhancement behind the left optic nerve. Visual 

acuity remained zero.

The incidence of ocular complications during ESS is rather low; they could be serious, leading to 

permanent 

dysfunction. The 

overall 

incidence 

of 

ESS 

complications 

are 

reported 

in 

several meta-analyses pointed its occurrence between 4.2–23% or 0.9–3.1%. There are only a 

few analysis of orbital complications during ESS. The incidence of this type of complications is 

range from 0.5% to 5%. However, due to the incidence of the disease and the high number of 

FESS procedures conducted year on year this number is quite significant.  2  

The orbit and its content are at risk during ESS because the lamina papyracea is very thin or 

may be incomplete. This site is the most potential risk area, especially when we do not have a 

good quality of vision or using powered instrumentation. The minor complications are referred 

to 

lamina 

papyracea 

injury mostly 

during maxillary 

antrostomy 

or ethmoidectomy. 

Complications are most common in patients with anatomical variations. These complications 

are commonly seen with hypoplastic maxillary sinus or Silent Sinus Syndrome (SSS). In this 

anatomic variants the uncinate very tightly connects to the lamina papyracea and should be 

resected with great attention. 2 The advent of the microdebrider was among the most important 

surgical instrument inventions in the field, advancing the treatment of sinonasal disease in a 

more visible field through its suction-based rotating blade however due to the thin lamina that 

patients are most at risk when the microdebrider can easily suction and sever periorbital and 

dura, which can then be misdirected into the orbit or brain 3   

The stages of surgery during which the orbit may be at the greatest risk of breach include 

ethmoidectomy or any ethmoid sinus surgery, and uncinectomy for the medial orbital wall, and 

maxillary antrostomy plus sinusotomy for the inferior orbit.

0.5–5%: Using 1%, 

that would equate 

to approximately 670,000 

cases of ophthalmic 

complications a year regardless of severity and grade. 

According to a market analysis report by Energias, the Global Sinusitis Treatment Market size is 

expected to reach USD 50.41 Billion in 2024, at a CAGR of 12.4% from 2018 to 2024. Factors 

propelling the growth of the market include a growing number of chronic sinusitis patients 

coupled with technological advancements in sinus surgery.

CURRENT METHODS USED FOR PREVENT ION OF OPHTHALM IC COMPL ICAT IONS 

The risk of inadvertent orbital entry may be minimized by the following means: 5, 6 

 

 

Good preoperative assessment 

Be wary of High-risk patients: Patients most at risk for complications include those with 

revision surgery, extensive disease, 

skull base anatomic or 

radiologic variations or 

dehiscences related to disease 

 

CT scanning: Assess the extent of the sinus disease and detect pre-existing anatomical 

variants. 

 

Both optic nerve and carotid artery form an indentation in the lateral wall of the sphenoid 

sinus. This can be unilateral or bilateral. 5%-7% of these have a dehiscent bone which 

exposes these two vital structures to the intraoperative injury. Preoperative imaging in the 

axial plane reveals excellent detail of the sphenoid sinus and its relationship with these two 

structures, thus avoiding iatrogenic complications. 

 

Thickness, contour, and presence of 

infraorbital or supraorbital structures should be 

identified. 

 

 

Early intraoperative location of the lamina papyracea provides a key landmark 

Special care must be exercised in using powered instrumentation 

11/23/18 Need Specification Documents – Minimal Access Surgery 

12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"," 

The anterior ethmoidal artery is a critical structure to identify in order to avoid intra-

operative bleeding. Coronal CT images show a bony nipple at the junction of the medial 

rectus and superior oblique muscles to identify a useful landmark for the location of this 

artery. 

 

Identification of sphenoethmoidal cells (Onodi), which occur in 8% to 14% of the general 

population before FESS is critical. Mistaking Onodi cells for the sphenoid sinus can lead to 

incomplete dissection and place the optic nerve and the orbit at risk. 

 

IV anesthesia, relative hypotension, and relative bradycardia minimize intraoperative blood 

loss. 

 

 

Topical decongestants, prothrombotic agents, and bipolar cautery should be available. 

Inspection of periorbita and periorbital fat if lamina papyracea is violated. If periorbita is 

not injured and there are no signs of orbital injury, surgery can proceed. If periorbita is cut, 

and orbital fat is exposed, intraocular pressure measurement and forced duction test should 

be performed. 

 

Blind cautery of the periorbital fat should be avoided to prevent injury to the EOMs and the 

ON. Bipolar electrocautery works well where bleeding does not involve the orbit itself. 

 

It is wise to keep the eyes uncovered during endoscopic surgery so that surgery can be 

stopped immediately if there is any indication of orbital swelling, afferent pupillary defect 

or eyelid bruising. 

 

Do not use nasal packing over the exposed orbital apex to avoid pressure on the ON. 

M AN AG EM EN T O F O P H T HA LM I C C OM P L I C A T I ON S  

The complications often observed post FESS include: 6 

Orbital Hematoma: Orbital hematoma is an ophthalmic emergency because an intraorbital 

bleed 

can 

rapidly 

produce 

an 

orbital 

compartment 

syndrome 

(visual 

loss, 

external 

ophthalmoplegia, tense orbit, central retinal artery occlusion) with permanent injury to the 

optic nerve if ischemia persists more than 90 minutes. The source of bleeding may be injured 

lamina papyracea, periorbita, extraocular muscles, or traction on the orbital fat resulting in 

avulsion of an orbital vessel. Ligate the artery in question. 

Diplopia: 15% to 63% of postoperative FESS patients report new onset diplopia or worsening 

of pre-existing symptoms of diplopia. Diplopia 

is due to change 

in the vector of pull of 

Extraocular muscles. Those who develop diplopia after decompression surgery often need 

strabismus surgery. 

Epiphora: The incidence of this complication after FESS ranges from 0.3% to 1.7%. Endoscopic 

Dacryocystorhinostomy (EDCR) is the most commonly performed remedial surgery. Surgery on 

frontal sinus may damage lacrimal sac, whereas uncinectomy or middle meatal antrostomy may 

injure the nasolacrimal duct within the lacrimal canal. 

Complications Related to Optic Nerve Sheath Decompression: This includes damage to the 

optic nerve fibers, ophthalmic artery, CSF leakage, meningitis etc. clear risks and absence of the 

data to suggest benefits of sheath decompression do not recommend this procedure in general.

","Neuro-ophthalmic Complications: Anisocoria and accommodation palsy have been reported 

after endoscopic surgery. There is a favorable response to oral corticosteroids. Image aided 

neuro-ophthalmic procedures have made the procedure safer and improved the prognosis. 

Optic Nerve Injury and FESS: Traumatic optic neuropathy may be direct or indirect. Direct 

traumatic optic neuropathy results from penetrating injuries where the intra-orbital portion of 

the optic nerve (ON) is generally injured. Indirect traumatic optic neuropathy is due to blunt 

head trauma with or without associated fractures of the orbital canal. The ON is at risk of injury 

within the sphenoid sinus, especially if there is a thin piece of bone or mucosa, separating the 

nerve from the sinus cavity. Maybe treated by decompression or steroid usage. 

Extraocular Muscles (EOM) Complications: Detachment of the EOMs from the globe and their 

retraction into the posterior orbit can occur secondary to trauma or as a surgical complication. 

The muscle(s) may be ruptured or transected as a result of the injury. It is possible that a small 

defect in the orbital wall could allow a powered cutting instrument to aspirate orbital fat and or 

EOM into the sinus without entering the orbit. Loss of a rectus muscle may also occur as a 

complication of strabismus surgery, retinal detachment surgery, orbital surgery, or paranasal 

sinus surgery. 

Orbital Abscess: Sinusitis continues to be the most common cause of orbital inflammation and 

infection, especially in children. May require orbital decompression.

Image-guided sinus surgery: Image-Guided surgery is a more detailed form of the FESS, which 

uses infrared signals and CT scans to get a more accurate picture of the sinus cavities in real 

time. This allows doctors to precisely target areas of concern while minimizing risk to arteries 

and other tissues that don't need to be removed. The advancements made in camera and 

telescopic technologies have allowed Image Guided surgery to become one of the most effective 

sinus surgery solutions on the market. 7 

Balloon Sinuplasty: This procedure offers patients the same sinus relief without any cutting or 

removal of sinus tissues. Instead, this method uses a small catheter and balloon that is inserted 

into the sinus cavity and inflated. As the balloon expands, it pushes the walls of the sinus cavi ty 

open and restructures them with a wider opening, without damaging the integrity of the lining 

of the sinus cavity. 7 

Medicated, dissolvable sinus stent: The PROPEL® sinus stent is another innovation intended 

to optimize recovery following endoscopic sinus surgery. Once the sinus is opened by the 

surgeon, the stent is inserted into the sinus that has been operated on, and it helps hold the 

sinus cavity open. As it does so, it also delivers anti-inflammatory medicine to the sinus tissue. 

The medicine is released for about 30 days. As the stent delivers drug it will dissolve over a 30 

to 45 day period. The PROPEL sinus stent is proven to improve the outcomes of surgery by 

holding the sinuses open and treating the underlying inflammation. 8

Port site hernia (PSH) 

is a rare 

type of 

incisional hernia occurring at port sites after 

laparoscopic surgery. The incidence of PSH has an overall incidence of 1.7%. There are few 

prospective studies designed with the aim of identifying postoperative PSH. In these studies, the 

overall incidence was 3.2%. 1 

In large studies published prior to 1995 were identified, the incidence of PSH reported in each 

study 0.20%, 0.15%, and 0.13%, respectively which is considerably lower than more recent 

studies.  The umbilicus is the most common port associated with incisional hernia, other sites 

include the epigastrium, the right hypochondrium, left hypochondrium. In the majority of cases, 

PSH is not associated with any strangulation or bowel obstruction. 1  

The incidence of port site hernia increases with the size of the trocar but there are other risk 

factors like the incision enlargement, infection, diabetes mellitus, obesity, the type of trocar 

used, male sex, connective tissue disorders and most importantly the defective closure of the 

fascial defect at the port site.1 

O B S E R V A T I ON 

A 40-year-old male presented to the emergency surgery ward with complaints of pain abdomen, 

distention abdomen, obstipation and two episodes of bilious vomiting for one day. The pain was 

diffusely present over the whole abdomen. On examination, tenderness was present in the 

whole abdomen with specific guarding present in the periumbilical area. There was a gurgling 

sensation just beneath the skin indicating the possibility of an obstructed gut loop which was 

found to be irreducible. He had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy two days before 

presentation and was discharged 24 hours prior. Ultrasonogram abdomen indicated only the 

dilated small bowel loops and abdominal radiographs revealed air-fluid levels in the erect film 

and grossly dilated bowel loops in the supine film. He was taken up for surgery and the 

abdomen was opened through the midline laparotomy incision extending a few centimeters 

above and below the umbilicus. The cherry colored gut loop was found lying just below the skin, 

herniating out of the peritoneal and the fascial defect at the umbilical port site. The loop was 

obstructed at the fascial defect. The defected fascia and the peritoneum were carefully opened 

and the loop was delivered out. Pregangrenous changes were present at the part of the loop 

stuck at the defect. The proximal bowel was grossly dilated while the distal bowel was 

somewhat collapsed. The obstructed area was approximately one foot from the ileocaecal 

junction. Approximately 500 to 600 ml of dark red edema fluid was also drained from the 

peritoneal cavity. The pregangrenous part of the ileum was kept under the warm saline soaked 

sponge and the patient was given 100% oxygen for full 5 minutes. The color and the peristalsis 

of the gut loop were rechecked and were found to have grossly improved. The small intestine 

was decompressed antegrade and retrograde, the wash was given and the abdomen was closed 

in layers with the proper anatomical repair of the fascia and the peritoneum. The patient

in the postoperative period and the bowel sounds returned on the third 

postoperative day and the patient passed stools and flatus on the fourth postoperative day. The 

patient was allowed liquids on the third postoperative day and was discharged on full oral diet 

and treatment on the seventh postoperative day with a healthy stitch line.  

T H E PRO B L EM  

Very few prospective studies have aimed at identifying the risk factors for PSH. No randomized 

studies have been performed to date. The factors predisposing to PSH can be divided into 

patient factors and operative factors  

Patient Factors 1 

 

Preexisting umbilical/paraumbilical hernia: This has been identified in several reports 

as a risk factor for PSH in several studies  

Preexisting umbilical or paraumbilical defects 

Male gender: Males seem to have a higher incidence of hernias 

Obesity: Obesity has been suggested as a predisposing factor for PSH by some studies 

Medical 

comorbidities: 

Diabetes mellitus, COPD 

(chronic 

obstructive 

pulmonary 

 

 

 

 

disease), renal failure, AIDS 

Operative Factors 1 

 

 

Trocar diameter: This has been widely reported as a factor in the development of PSH 

Port Insertion Technique: Primary port insertion is either by a closed or open technique. 

Secondary ports are less often the site of hernia development, but hernias do occur at 

secondary port sites.  

 

Type of trocar used: The type of trocar used is thought to be a determining factor. They can 

be divided 

into cutting trocars and dilating trocars. The common cutting trocars are 

reusable metal pyramidal trocars and disposable metal bladed trocars with or without a 

sprung protective sleeve. They require less force to use but have a higher incidence of 

complications. Dilating or “radially expanding” trocars bluntly separate abdominal wall 

tissues and are thought to be associated with less bleeding and pain but require greater 

application of force. New hybrid designs have also been developed.  

 

Port extension: Case reports identify extension of the port incision especially to facilitate 

extraction of an organ such as the gallbladder as a risk factor for PSH 

 Wound infection: Infections at the port site has been implicated in the pathogenesis of 

umbilical incisional hernia in some case reports 

 

Insertion of a drain: The use of a drain placed through a port site has been suggested as a 

risk factor for PSH in 2 studies, although this has not been fully evaluated. 

 

Effects of Compressed Air. Carbon dioxide might push the omentum or intestinal loops 

through the point of insertion in the fascia. The protruding structures might then be trapped 

by abdominal muscle contractions. 2

CURRENT METHODS USED FOR PREVENT ION OF PORT S ITE HERN IA 

Peri-operative improvement of health status: Martindale published an extensive review of 

perioperative interventions including smoking cessation, blood glucose control, and obesity. 

Smoking cessation for 4 weeks was found to be associated with a decrease in complication rate 

from 41% to 21% and Preoperative blood glucose control with hemoglobin A1c less than 7% 

and blood glucose between 140-160 mg/dL. 5 

Identify any previously undetected hernia: Conduct an examination of the fascia through the 

port site during surgery.  

Careful suturing of the fascia of the umbilical port: Careful closure with sutures and where 

there 

is 

a preexisting hernia, 

formal 

repair 

should be undertaken with 

interrupted 

nonabsorbable sutures. 

Use umbilical port as the extraction site: This minimizes the number of sites at increased risk 

of herniation.  

Small Secondary ports: This port should be kept to as small in diameter as possible  

Use of Dilating or hybrid ports: These port should be used in preference to cutting ports 

Avoid reinsertion of ports and unnecessary torsion

needle, a suture carrier, a 2-mm trocar or a Deschamps needle to close the fascia and the

 

 

Ultrasound and X-ray radiographs 

CT: PSH of early-onset type can be located by computed tomography and surgically reduce 

and repair the hernia with minimal enlargement of the puncture wound, thus avoiding a full 

laparotomy. In many other reports computed tomography was available to diagnose early-

onset–type hernias and were effective in diagnosing them. 2  

 

Gastrointestinal contrast study: Found to be effective in 3 reports.2

 

Non-operative management: Nasogastric suction and other methods are said to often 

waste time and money, and they sometimes lead to critical conditions such as strangulation. 



procedure will vary: The bowel involvement can occur in the form of bowel incarceration, 

bowel obstruction or bowel evisceration. All these are considered surgical emergencies that 

can present a few days to weeks after the primary procedure.

Intestinal 

anastomosis 

is 

a 

surgical procedure performed 

to 

establish 

communication 

between two formerly distant portions of the intestine. This procedure restores 

intestinal 

continuity after removal of a pathologic condition affecting the bowel. 1 

Indications for intestinal anastomosis can be broadly divided into two categories: restoration of 

bowel continuity following resection of diseased bowel and bypass of the unresectable diseased 

bowel. Certain pediatric conditions may also require intestinal anastomosis. 1 

Resection of diseased bowel is performed in the following settings: Bowel gangrene due to 

vascular compromise, Malignancy, Benign conditions (eg, intestinal polyps, intussusception), 

Infections (eg, tuberculosis), Traumatic perforations, Large perforations, Radiation enteritis, 

Inflammatory bowel disease, Chronic constipation, 

idiopathic slow transit constipation, or 

Hirschsprung disease. 1 

Bypass of unresectable diseased bowel is performed in following settings: Locally advanced 

tumor causing 

luminal obstruction, Metastatic disease-causing 

intestinal obstruction, Poor 

general condition or condition that prevents major resection 1 

Anastomotic leak (AL) is one of the most dreaded complications following colorectal surgery, 

with reported rates ranging from 3 to 26%. The concern over this complication is for good 

reason as it is associated with a mortality ranging from 6 to 39%. Many studies have looked at 

the potential causative factors of AL, and although male sex, poor nutritional status, obes ity, and 

an increased number of blood transfusions may be risk factors, the level of the anastomosis is 

the most consistent risk factor for an AL. There appears to be an increased leak rate at the 

anastomotic site if done at or below 7 cm from the anal verge. 2  

Surgeons are all too familiar with the potentially devastating consequences of an anastomotic 

leak. Patients classically develop agonizing abdominal pain, tachycardia, high fevers, and a rigid 

abdomen, often accompanied by hemodynamic instability. In these cases, urgent return to the 

operating room for peritoneal washout and fecal diversion is generally required; prolonged 

stays in the intensive care unit and death are not uncommon. Further, anastomotic leakage has 

been associated with increased local recurrence and diminished survival after colorectal cancer 

surgery. 2 

However, a large number of patients ultimately found to have an anastomotic leak develop a 

more insidious presentation, often with low-grade fever, prolonged ileus, or failure to thrive. In 

these patients, making the diagnosis may be much more difficult as the clinical course is often 

similar to other postoperative infectious complications. Radiologic imaging is usually required; 

even then, the diagnosis may be elusive or at least uncertain. 3

A 46-year-old male was scheduled to undergo a gastrojejunostomy due to severe peptic ulcer 

disease. The abdomen was entered using Veress needle insufflations. 4 to 5 trocars were placed 

in the upper abdomen under direct vision, with 1 to 2 of these trocars being 12mm in size and 

the rest being 5mm. After placement of trocars, the greater curvature of the stomach was 

identified. The gastrocolic omentum was opened using an ultrasonic or Harmonic scalpel. The 

lesser sac was entered, and the distal stomach was identified. The position on the distal stomach 

for the creation of the GJ was based on the surgeon's preference. A loop of small bowel 

approximately 30cm 

to 50cm distal 

to 

the 

ligament 

of Treitz was 

chosen 

for 

the 

gastrojejunostomy. A laparoscopic stay suture was used to align the small bowel segment in an 

antecolic manner to the anterior or posterior wall of the stomach. Enterotomies were then 

made with cautery in both the jejunum and stomach. 2 to 3 staplers were used to create the 

anastomosis. The common enterotomy was closed laparoscopically with 2 layers of sutures. 

The patient had an anastomotic leak requiring open repair of GJ on postoperative day 5. This 

patient had an arduous postoperative course complicated by septic shock, respiratory failure 

necessitating a tracheostomy, and formation of an enterocutaneous fistula that was repaired 3 

weeks later. She ultimately improved and was discharged to subacute rehabilitation 10 weeks 

after her initial surgery. 

T H E PRO B L EM  

Anastomotic leakage is the most feared early complication of intestinal anastomosis.  

A great deal is known about the healing of the external skin after injury, but much less is known 

about intestinal healing. This is due to the easy accessibility of the skin as it heals as opposed to 

the intestinal mucosa. The gastrointestinal tract wall is composed of the surrounding serosa; the 

smooth muscle-containing muscularis propria; the collagen-containing submucosa providing 

tensile strength; and the epithelial mucosa and mucous layer that provide the interface with and 

the barrier to the luminal contents. Most importantly the intestinal mucosa heals in close 

contact with the intestinal microbiota, the densest biomass in the body.  The healing of an 

intestinal anastomosis occurs in three phases: 1 

 

 

 

Inflammatory phase 

Fibroplasia phase 

Remodeling phase 

During the inflammatory phase, the integrity depends on the mechanical strength provided by 

sutures. The inflammatory phase is followed by the fibroplasia phase around postoperative 

days 5-7. Collagen deposition occurs in this phase, which gives strength to the anastomosis. Any 

systemic or local factor that causes a delay in the transition from the inflammatory phase to the 

fibroplasia phase can result in poor healing and anastomotic leakage.  

11/23/18 Need Specification Documents – Minimal Access Surgery 

23 

 
 
 
 
 
","Systemic conditions that increase the risk of anastomotic leakage include anemia, diabetes 

mellitus, malnutrition, hypoalbuminemia, vitamin deficiencies, and steroids. Local factors which 

affect healing include radiation, disease-affected bowel, and inadequate blood flow.  

Anastomotic leakage presenting on postoperative day 1 or 2 is invariably due to technical 

reasons. Anastomotic leakage secondary to interference in the normal healing mechanism 

usually presents around the end of postoperative week 1. Anastomotic leakage can present 

either as frank peritonitis when the 

leak 

is uncontrolled or as 

localized 

intra-abdominal 

collection/abscess if the leak is controlled. A leak with diffuse peritonitis is associated with high 

morbidity and mortality and necessitates re-exploratory surgery.

As was mentioned in the background section, the 

indications for 

intestinal resection and 

anastomosis are extensive. Unfortunately, data on the frequency of these procedures across the 

country is hard to come by but given the incidence of colorectal cancers, peptic ulcer disease in 

India these are not infrequent. 

In the USA alone the number of colorectal procedures carried out per year is said to be 320,000 

as per the report titled Trends in Operating Room Procedures in U.S. Hospitals, 2001–2011. If 

we assume that the proportion of procedures to population is constant that would entail that 

there are 12,80,000 colorectal procedures alone performed in India. Given the incidence of 

anastomotic leak that would entail a range of 3840 – 3,32,800 in colorectal procedures alone.  

Given the poor surgical outcomes, repeat procedures, sepsis, and mortality risk this is certainly 

an important unmet need to be addressed.

CURRENT METHODS USED FOR PREVENT ION OF AN ASTOMOT IC LEAK 

The risk of inadvertent nerve trauma due to an accidental transaction or heat-related injury 

may be minimized by the following means:  

Risk factors & Prediction: Extensive literature is available on the topic of risk factors for 

anastomotic leakage. These include male gender, smoking, obesity, alcohol abuse, preoperative 

steroid 

and non-steroidal 

anti-inflammatory drugs use, 

longer duration 

of 

operation, 

preoperative transfusion, contamination of the operative field and timing during duty hour. In a 

study of 452 consecutive patients undergoing bowel resection with anastomosis, Erb et al found 

that abnormal vital signs were common after surgery and did not accurately predict the 

presence of 

anastomotic 

leaks. In postoperative week 1, 

fever, 

tachycardia, 

tachypnea, 

hypotension, and leukocytosis occurred daily in approximately 70% of patients who did not 

have anastomotic leaks and in more than 90% of those who did. The positive predictive values 

for fever, hypotension, and tachypnea were 11%, 4%, and 4%, respectively. Recently, risk factor 

studies have also been undertaken for laparoscopic colorectal surgery, identifying body mass 

index, tumor distance from the anal verge, tumor depth, and pelvic outlet as independent 

predictors for 

increased operative time and morbidity after 

laparoscopic total mesorectal 

excision 4, 5 

Surgical technique: Although some prerequisites should be present as adequate blood flow, 

without any tension in the absence of peritonitis, no clear value can be given for these aspects. 

Although 

there 

is 

little supporting evidence an 

inverting single 

layer continuous suture 

technique with slowly absorbable monofilament material seems preferable. Strong evidence 

lacks for other important aspects as the distance from the suture to the edge of the anastomosis, 

the distance between the sutures, layers included in the suture, suture tension and the optimal 

configuration. With regards to stapling vs hand-sewn anastomosis in colorectal anastomosis 

these are found to be equally effective although stapling techniques might be of preference since 

the technique is uniform and easy to learn, making it ideal for comparing results between 

hospitals and surgeons and for teaching young surgeons. There is a need for the development of 

new techniques since all previous research has not lead to radically decreased leakage rates. 6 

Extra-luminal sealing using fibrin glue or acrylates: These agents are reported mostly in 

animal studies but the few reports on their use in human colorectal anastomosis have not 

shown beneficial effects on colorectal anastomosis. 6  

Endo-luminal sealing by means of a biodegradable barrier: This technique has shown to be 

successfully applied in humans and a multicentre randomized clinical trial is currently being 

undertaken. 6 

Leak Test: 

Intraoperative evaluation, 

is commonly performed 

following 

the creation of 

esophageal, gastric, and rectal anastomoses, where the anastomosis is proximal or distal enough 

in the bowel to be accessible by endoscopy. 7 

11/23/18 Need Specification Documents – Minimal Access Surgery 

25 

 
 
 
 
","Diverting Ileostomy: In colorectal anastomoses, some surgeons perform a diverting ileostomy. 

This procedure and its subsequent reversal carry the independent risks of morbidity and add 

costs, the impact that diversion has on prevention of anastomotic leak remains unclear. The 

theory behind fecal diversion is that it eliminates the anastomotic stress of bowel wall dilation 

during healing and that any leakage that occurs has less severe consequences by avoiding large 

volume of fecal spillage. 7 

Trans-anal drainage tubes, Trans-anal sponge: The vacuum drainage developed for wound 

therapy, represent an alternative treatment for anterior rectal anastomotic leaks. The principle 

of this method is the application of negative pressure on the wound surface with the help of a 

sponge connected to a pump. The physiological mechanism of this improvement in wound 

healing is the effective removal of fluid, tissue edema and bacteria, with subsequently improved 

local blood 

circulation, which 

in 

turn 

stimulates wound healing 

(increased growth of 

granulation tissue). 8, 9 

Fat cell Harvesting: Cytori Therapeutics has developed a method of harvesting regenerative 

cells from subcutaneous fat. These cells, which include a high proportion of stem cells, can be 

used for a variety of applications, including wound healing and treating inflammation. 10

Early detection 6 

Clinical assessment: Anastomotic 

leakage becomes apparent between 

the 5th and 

the 

8th postoperative day, but exceptions do exist. Clinical 

signs 

include 

those of 

systemic 

inflammatory response syndrome:  fever, ileus, and pain are frequent. However as mentioned 

earlier but have low positive predictive value.  

Risk scores: Clinical scoring systems such as the Dutch Leakage Score was shown to be useful 

in those patients with a higher score were prone to anastomotic leak and required intensive 

clinical observation or radiological evaluation. Scoring systems can reduce delays in diagnosis of 

anastomotic leak and decreases false negative diagnostic imaging representing a major factor of 

delay in diagnosis. Although it is not known if the application of the score leads to an increase of 

negative imaging, the score could be especially beneficial in daily clinical practice where young 

doctors and nursing staff could identify high-risk patients very easily and in a standardized 

manner. 6 

CRP based prediction: This interval between surgery and clinical onset suggests a preclinical 

phase 

in which non-clinical methods could be used 

in prediction. Consequently, routine 

postoperative measurement of serum level CRP is studied for infectious complications after 

colorectal surgery in general and anastomotic leak in particular. CRP and other biochemical 

parameters detect systemic reactions, while other techniques are recently applied to detect 

local, juxta-anastomotic changes in metabolism and ischemia.  6 

11/23/18 Need Specification Documents – Minimal Access Surgery 

26 

 
 
 
 
 
","Microdialysis of the peritoneal cavity: This is a technique that uses an indwelling two-lumen 

catheter that detects changes in oxygenation locally at the site of the anastomosis. Few studies 

have shown 

the ability 

to distinguish patients with colorectal anastomosis after rectum 

resection from patients with an uncomplicated course, although these have insufficient samples 

to provide predictive values. 6 

Future solutions/studies should focus on preclinical detection of leaks since patients that are 

reoperated in an early phase could be protected from septic sequellae of anastomotic leak. 6 

Treatment 

When facing and treating patients with an anastomotic leak, surgeons have to take into account 

many different aspects, i.e., age, health status and current clinical condition of the patient, extent 

of dehiscence, the time between operation and reoperation, indication of primary resection, 

presence of diverting stoma and 

localization of the anastomosis. These variables 

lead to 

individualization of treatment strategies and incomparable outcome. However, few studies, 

showing that surgeons believe that the anastomosis can be repaired rather than dismantled, 

have paved the way for a trial in which next to mortality and morbidity, preservation of the 

anastomosis could be one of the endpoints Difficulties 

in designing such a trial are the 

aforementioned large variety of clinical course, the unpredictability of anastomotic leak  and the 

relatively low incidence of anastomotic leak per center.

Cirrhosis, the end stage of any chronic liver disease, can lead to portal hypertension. Portal 

pressure increases initially as a consequence of an increased resistance to flow mostly due to an 

architectural distortion of the liver secondary to fibrous tissue and regenerative nodules. In 

addition 

to 

this 

structural 

resistance 

to blood 

flow, 

there 

is 

an 

active 

intrahepatic 

vasoconstriction that accounts for 20–30% of the increased intrahepatic resistance, and that is 

mostly due to a decrease in the endogenous production of nitric oxide. Portal hypertension 

leads to the formation of portosystemic collaterals. However, portal hypertension persists 

despite the development of these collaterals for 2 reasons: 1) an increase in portal venous 

inflow that results from splanchnic arteriolar vasodilatation occurring concomitant with the 

formation of collaterals; and 2) insufficient portal decompression through collaterals as these 

have a higher resistance than that of the normal liver. Therefore, an increased portal pressure 

gradient results from both an increase in resistance to portal flow (intrahepatic and collateral) 

and an increase in portal blood inflow. 1 

Direct measurement of portal pressure 

is highly 

invasive and no 

longer performed. The 

preferred, albeit indirect, method for assessing portal pressure is the wedged hepatic venous 

pressure (WHVP) measurement, which is obtained by placing a catheter in the hepatic vein and 

wedging it into a small branch or, better still, by inflating a balloon and occluding a larger 

branch of the hepatic vein. The WHVP has been shown to correlate very closely with portal 

pressure both in alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhosis. 1 

 Nowadays, 

the most well-documented marker 

for 

portal 

venous 

pressure 

is HVPG 

measurement. There is data on the ability of HVPG to predict overall liver-related outcomes 

including risk for variceal hemorrhage. It has been proposed that serial HVPG measurement 

could assess fibrosis or cirrhosis despite etiology. Taken together, HVPG measurement can be 

used 

in 

the diagnosis of 

liver 

fibrosis, risk stratification, 

identification of patients with 

hepatocellular carcinoma, monitoring of the efficacy of medical treatment, and assessment of 

progression of portal hypertension. 2 

O B S E R V A T I ON 

A 45-year-old female who was a known case of hepatitis C presented with melena (blood in 

stools) and 3 episodes of haematemesis (blood in vomitus) for one day. She had mild distention 

& diffuse tenderness of the abdomen. The patient was diagnosed with Decompensated liver 

disease with upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to ruptured esophageal varices. A 

large 

quantity of blood was drained through her nasogastric tube on lavage. The blood pressure was 

100/50 and the pulse rate was 130 beats per minute despite IV fluid replacement and blood 

transfusion was advised. The patient was transfused with 3 pints of blood and was shifted for 

emergency variceal banding. Variceal banding was attempted and 3 bands were applied but 

were eventually discarded due to excessive bleeding due to lack of visibility and sclerotherapy

due to mucosal involvement during banding. 

T H E PRO B L EM  

Antecubital, femoral, or right jugular veins are possible routes for insertion of a catheter in 

HVPG measurement. In case of right jugular vein insertion, a 6 French balloon catheter is placed 

in the right hepatic vein through a right jugular vein puncture for measurement of the FHVP. 

The WHVP is measured by inflation of the balloon catheter at the right hepatic vein. The WHVP 

is always corrected for increases in intraabdominal pressure (e.g., ascites) by subtracting the 

free hepatic vein pressure (FHVP) or the intraabdominal inferior vena cava pressure, which act 

as internal zeroes. The resultant pressure is the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), 

which is best accomplished with the use of a balloon catheter, usually taking triplicate readings 

and, when measured with a proper technique, is very reproducible and reliable. Since it is a 

measure of sinusoidal pressure, the HVPG will be elevated in intrahepatic causes of portal 

hypertension, such as cirrhosis, but will be normal in prehepatic causes of portal hypertension, 

such as portal vein thrombosis. In the normal liver, inter-connected sinusoidal network partially 

dissipates the pressure backup from the wedged catheter, and the WHVP is slightly lower than 

directly-measured portal pressure. In LC, the inter-sinusoidal communications are blocked by 

fibrous tissue, dissipation of pressure in the wedged vessels is insignificant and the WHVP 

accurately estimates portal pressure. The normal HVPG is 3–5 mmHg. The HVPG and changes in 

HVPG that occur over time have predictive value for the development of esophagogastric 

varices, the risk of variceal hemorrhage, the development of non-variceal complications of 

portal hypertension, and death. Single measurements are useful 

in the prognosis of both 

compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, while repeat measurements are useful to monitor 

response to pharmacological therapy and progression of liver disease.  

Only minor complications such as mainly transient cardiac arrhythmias, local pain, or vagal 

reaction have been 

reported and 

these occur 

infrequently 

(< 1% of patients). HVPG 

measurements can be performed in 10 minutes with trans-jugular liver biopsy through the 

same route. Despite its advantages such as safety, feasibility, and reproducibility, the technique 

is invasive. Besides its invasive nature, limitations to the generalized use of HVPG measurement 

are low acceptance rate among patients with chronic liver disease and requires highly skilled 

technical expertise, the lack of expertise and poor adherence to guidelines will lead to the 

unreliable and irreproducible measurements. The invasiveness and technical difficulty greatly 

restrict its repeatable application. 1

CURRENT METHODS USED FOR D IAGNOS IS AND MON ITOR ING L IVER D ISEASE 1 

Various techniques have/are currently being used to monitor various pressure measurements 

within the liver as well as measure the amount of fibrosis which is a key reason for structural 

resistance to blood flow. 

 Wedged hepatic venous pressure (WHVP): WHVP estimates portal venous pressure by 

occlusive hepatic vein catheterization. either with a wedge catheter or a balloon catheter. 

 

Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG): HVPG measurement is the best available 

method to evaluate the presence and severity of portal hypertension. Clinically significant 

portal hypertension is defined as an increase in HVPG to >10 mmHg.Currently, a safe, 

reproducible and less invasive technique to measure the HVPG has been developed. HVPG 

represents the gradient between the portal vein and the hepatic vein 

 

Transient Elastography: The device works by measuring shear wave velocity. In this 

technique, a 50-MHz wave is passed into the liver from a small transducer on the end of an 

ultrasound probe. The probe also has a transducer on the end that can measure the velocity 

of the shear wave (in meters per second) as this wave passes through the liver. The shear 

wave velocity can then be converted into liver stiffness, which is expressed in kilopascals. 

Essentially, the technology measures the velocity of the sound wave passing through the 

liver and then converts that measurement into a liver stiffness measurement; the entire 

process is often referred to as liver ultrasonographic elastography. 4 

 

Liver Biopsy: The gold standard to stage fibrosis in the liver. It is used in diagnosing and 

grading liver diseases, and to guide therapeutic decisions. It can be performed either by 

percutaneous or transvenous (transjugular) routes. 3 

 

Computed tomography angiography: A novel noninvasive assessment of hepatic venous 

pressure gradient and portal pressure using 

 CTA performed with multi-detector CT 

scanners. 5 

 

Magnetic resonance elastography, multiparametric magnetic resonance 

imaging: 

These 

techniques hold promise and are being 

investigated as surrogates of portal 

hypertension, particularly in patients who are not appropriate candidates for ultrasound 

elastography. 6 

 

Ultrasonography: USG is the first-line imaging technique recommended for the diagnosis 

and follow-up of patients with portal hypertension since it is noninvasive, cheap and can be

","performed at the bedside. The US is highly specific for the diagnosis of cirrhosis and portal 

hypertension, but its sensitivity is relatively low in compensated patients.7 

 

Spleen stiffness: Since splenomegaly 

in cirrhosis 

is a direct consequence of portal 

hypertension, spleen stiffness has been recently proposed as a new noninvasive parameter 

with better accuracy 

than 

liver 

stiffness 

for predicting 

clinically 

significant portal 

hypertension and esophageal varices. 7

For individuals with compensated cirrhosis and mild portal hypertension, the AASLD provides 

the following guidance 

 

The 

treatment goal 

is 

to prevent 

the development of clinically significant portal 

hypertension (CSPH)/decompensation and, perhaps, even to achieve regression of 

cirrhosis. 

 

 

Elimination of the etiologic agent is the current mainstay of therapy. 

Drugs that act on portal 

flow, such as nonselective beta-blockers, will be mostly 

ineffective in this substage, given that the hyperdynamic circulatory state is not fully 

developed. 

For individuals with compensated cirrhosis and CSPH but without gastroesophageal varices, the 

AASLD recommends the following: 

 

The goal of treatment should be to prevent clinical decompensation (ie, it is no longer 

the objective to prevent varices). 

 

No evidence exists at present to recommend the use of nonselective beta-blockers to 

prevent the formation of varices.

Iatrogenic (hospital-related) ureteral injury is a serious complication that can occur during 

abdominal or pelvic operations. Despite the low incidence rate (0.3% to 1.5%), ureteral injuries 

can lead to significant morbidity. Some studies identified risk factors such as resection of large 

pelvic masses, malignant neoplasms, inflammatory disease, previous operation, or radiation 

therapy. 1 In a study by Ostrzenski et. al. a total of 70 instances of ureteral injury during 

laparoscopic 

surgery were 

identified among 2491 

reported 

cases. The 2491 

cases of 

laparoscopy included case reports, small series of studies, as well as longer, consecutive studies. 

In 25.7% of cases, the initial laparoscopic procedures during which ureteral injury occurred 

were not described or specified. In cases in which the type of laparoscopic surgery was specified, 

20.0% of the total cases of ureteral injury occurred during laparoscopically assisted vaginal 

hysterectomy (LAVH). A ureteral injury was identified intraoperatively in only 8.6% of cases, 

postoperatively in 70% of cases, and, in 21.4% of cases, the time of diagnosis was not specified. 

In instances in which the types of injury were described, transection occurred most commonly, 

accounting 20.0% of the injuries. Injuries most often occurred at or above the pelvic brim with  

Electrocautery involved in 17 of the 70 (24.3%) cases of ureteral injury. A laparotomy was used 

to repair the ureteral injury in 43 of 70 (61.4%) cases thus exemplifying the morbidity involved 

in the ureteral injury. 2 Ureteral injury is one of the most serious complications of gynecologic 

surgery. Less common than injuries to the bladder or rectum, ureteral injuries are far more 

serious and troublesome and are often associated with significant morbidity, the formation 

of ureterovaginal 

fistulas, and 

the potential 

loss of kidney 

function, especially when not 

recognized until postoperatively. For these reasons, injuries to the urinary tract, particularly the 

ureter, are the most common cause for legal action against gynecologic surgeons.3

An 80-year-old female patient had a history of a mass per rectum for the past 6 months. It was 

symptomatic 

for 

the past 3 weeks with 

fecal 

incontinence She underwent 

laparoscopic 

rectopexy with a mesh. The abdominal cavity is entered by using the Hasson approach. Once the 

camera port is inserted and the abdomen is insufflated, a right lower port and a right upper 

quadrant port was placed. A 30° scope was introduced into the umbilical port. To improve 

exposure, an additional port can be placed on the left flank. If the patient has a uterus that is 

affecting exposure, it can be retracted with a stitch to the anterior abdominal wall. Dissection is 

started posteriorly. The plane between the mesorectum and retroperitoneum is identified then 

the posterior pelvic plane under the superior rectal artery is entered, and the left ureter and 

hypogastric nerve plexus are identified; dissection is extended downward through the presacral 

anatomical space, all the way to the pelvic floor. The dissection must be carried below the 

Waldeyer fascia. Once the right stalk and posterior areas were mobilized, dissection proceeded

The patient presented with signs and symptoms of abdominal pain and fever with flank pain

injury was suspected. 

Immediate cystoscopy and retrograde 

pyelogram was performed for diagnosis of a suspected ureteral injury and was confirmed . 

T H E PRO B L EM  

A significant ureteral injury is defined as any recognized or unrecognized iatrogenic trauma to 

the ureter that prevents it from functioning properly or effectively. The injury may lead to acute 

ureteral obstruction (eg, a ureter that is inadvertently ligated) or discontinuity (ie, inadvertent 

ureteral resection). If an injury to the ureter has occurred and is unrecognized, it may lead to 

chronic ureteral obstruction (ie, crush injury, ischemia) or the formation of fistulas. Serious 

urinary complications after major operative laparoscopy were discovered in 1.6% of patients. 

This incidence compares favorably to serious urinary complications after standard gynecologic 

surgery. Intraoperative recognition of these complications will likely avoid additional surgery. 

Major operative laparoscopic procedures included hysterectomy, adnexectomy, treatment of 

tubal pregnancy, ovarian cystectomy, and ablation-fulguration of severe endometriosis (stage 

IV). The 6 most common mechanisms of operative ureteral injury are as follows: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Crushing from misapplication of a clamp 

Ligation with a suture 

Transsection (partial or complete) 

Angulation of the ureter with secondary obstruction 

Ischemia from ureteral stripping or electrocoagulation 

Resection of a segment of ureter 

Ureteral injuries may have numerous consequences, including the following: 

 

 

Spontaneous resolution and healing of the injured ureter 

Hydronephrosis: The urine from the ipsilateral kidney is prevented from draining into the 

bladder, leading to hydronephrosis and progressive deterioration of renal function. It may 

even have led to infection (pyelonephrosis) 

 

Ureteral necrosis with urinary extravasation: A section of the ureteral wall necroses (death 

of cells) due to pressure. This segment of the ureter eventually weakens, leading to urinary 

leakage into the surrounding tissues. 

 

Ureteral stricture formation: Strictures may lead to blockage of the ureter thus blocking the 

passage of urine 

 

Uremia: An end-stage emergency condition in which excess nitrogenous waste is present in 

the circulation due to renal dysfunction 

The close anatomical relationship of the ureter with abdominal and pelvic organs increases the 

risk of injury. The course taken by the ureter in the pelvis is said to be ‘Fraught with Hazard’.

Epidemiology: In laparoscopic surgeries, the ureteral injury rate is between 0.3% to 2%. 

Assuming 18 million laparoscopic surgeries a year and using 0.3% that would equate to around 

5,400 cases of ureteral injury a year on average. The frequency of ureteral injury following 

gynecologic surgery too is approximately 1%, with a higher percentage of injuries occurring 

during abdominal hysterectomies and partial vaginectomies. Patients who have received pelvic 

radiation or who have advanced pelvic cancers requiring extensive surgical procedures are 

more likely to experience a ureteral injury. Ureteral injuries are seen during colorectal surgery 

too with incidence, ranging in the literature from 0.28–7.6%.  Although the incidence is not high, 

the morbidity associated with ureteral injury is significant both in terms of the additional 

laparotomy required for repair as well as the medico-legal implications for the healthcare 

provider. 7

CURRENT METHODS OF U RETERAL IN JURY PREVENT ION 1 

At present, four preventive measures are considered as having a high level of evidence (grade 

IA) according to major evidence-based guidelines:  

 

Anatomical localization: Requires a thorough understanding of intraoperative pelvic and 

retroperitoneal anatomy. 5 

 

Identification of peristalsis: To distinguish the ureter from other vascular structures, the 

ureter will typically elicit peristalsis on gentle stroking. Others have observed that the 

ureter has a characteristic snap when it is gently palpated. 5 

 

Avoidance of electrothermal injury: 5 Avoid using monopolar current close to the ureter. 5 

11/23/18 Need Specification Documents – Minimal Access Surgery 

36 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"," 

Preoperative intravenous pyelograms (IVP): Although its usefulness is debatable, IVPs 

have been used preoperatively to locate the ureters for surgery in patients with disease 

processes that may distort the ureters, such as pelvic masses or inflammatory disease. 6 

 

Ureteral stenting: Routine preoperative ureteral stenting has been advocated in cases 

where a difficult pelvic dissection is expected. However, recent reviews have shown that 

this measure does not affect the rate of ureteral injuries, even though it might help facilitate 

intraoperative detection of a respective lesion. Multiple catheters and stents exist in the 

market 5 

 

Lighted stents: These have been used to assist in identifying the location of the ureters 

during laparoscopic surgery to help prevent iatrogenic injury. These have also found to be 

compelling during. 7 

M AN AG EM EN T O F S U R G I C A L S I T E IN F E C T I O N S 

Depending on the type, duration, and location of the ureteral injury, surgical treatment may 

range from simple removal of a ligature to ureteroneocystostomy. The most common surgical 

treatments for ureteral injury are as follows: 

 

Simple removal of a ligature: If a clamp or ligature constricting the ureter is discovered, 

the clamp or ligature should be removed immediately, and the ureter should be examined. If 

ureteral peristalsis is preserved and damage is thought to be minimal, the ureter injury may 

be managed with observation. 

 

Ureteral stenting: If tissue 

ischemia or a partial transection of the ureteral wall 

is 

suspected, a ureteral stent should be placed. The purpose of the stent, which is typically 

placed cystoscopically, is to act as a structural backbone onto which the healing ureter may 

mold. It also guarantees drainage of urine from the renal pelvis directly into the urinary 

bladder. It also can work as a gentle dilator since it moves slightly in an up-and-down 

motion, associated with breathing, as the kidney unit moves. The use of the stent is thought 

to minimize the rate of obstruction of a ureteral stricture in the injured area. Ureteral stents 

have been shown repeatedly to act as an excellent scaffolding mechanism when a partial 

ureteral distraction has occurred, with excellent long-term patency rates. 

 

Ureteral resection and ureteroureterostomy: If extensive ischemia or necrosis is the 

result of an injury, the ureter injury is best treated by excising the injured segment of the 

ureter and reestablishing continuity with the urinary system. If the ureteral injury occurred 

above the pelvic brim, the simplest reconstruction is a ureteroureterostomy, a procedure 

that is indicated for injuries to short segments of the ureter (ie, < 2 cm), in which an 

anastomosis is performed between the 2 cut edges of the ureter. 8 

 

Transureteroureterostomy: If ureteroureterostomy cannot be performed technically and 

the 

defect 

is 

too 

proximal 

in 

the 

ureter 

for 

ureteroneocystostomy, transureteroureterostomy may be performed. The 

literature also 

demonstrates the long-term efficacy of transureteroureterostomy. 8 

 

Ureteroneocystostomy: If the ureteral 

injury occurred below the pelvic brim, where 

visualization of the ureter is difficult and where the vesical pedicles overlie the ureter, 

ureteroureterostomy 

is often 

too difficult 

to perform. 

In 

these 

cases, 2 

types of 

ureteroneocystostomy procedures are indicated, either a psoas hitch or a Boari flap, in 

which the bladder is mobilized to reach the easily identifiable ureter proximal to the injury.

The future of distal ureteral injuries is exciting, and the use of new technology may change the 

management of distal ureteral injuries entirely.  

Subintestinal submucosa (SIS): SIS can be used as a tissue scaffold, a new modality to treat 

ureteral injuries has emerged. While no current studies are being performed using SIS for the 

treatment of distal ureteral injuries, the placement of SIS may serve as a healing bridge between 

2 

injured ureteral ends. Although SIS will not drastically affect the management of short 

ureteral injuries or strictures, it may be useful in treating longer ureteral defects. 

Robotic Surgery: Robotic techniques also have the potential for use in repair of ureteral injury. 

In a review of 43 cases of robot-assisted repair of injuries to the ureter or bladder that occurred 

during obstetrical and gynecological surgical procedures, Gellhaus et al concluded that robotic 

repair 

is associated with good outcomes, appears safe and 

feasible, and can be used 

immediately after injury recognition or as a salvage procedure after prior attempted repair. 9

Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has provided surgeons with the opportunity to perform 

complex procedures with less morbidity and good outcomes. However, it is not without its 

associated potential complications. The types of complications range from more minor ones 

such as difficulty accessing the abdominal cavity (incidence rates 0.2–3.1%)  to those with 

significant morbidity such as vascular and organ injuries (incidence rates from 0.5% to as high 

as 20% depending on the type of MIS). While these complications rates may appear low, the 

number of patients affected is great, given the number of MIS procedures performed each year. 1 

Vascular injuries during laparoscopic surgeries are rare, seen in 0.2 in 1000 cases, however,

O B S E R V A T I ON 

49-year-old male patient with a history for asymptomatic cholelithiasis for the past one year. 6 

days ago he presented with a history of jaundice, fever and abdominal pain. He was diagnosed 

with acute cholecystitis and was treated symptomatically and with antibiotics for 6 days. He 

was posted for laparoscopic cholecystectomy once the symptoms subsided. The patient was 

under GA. A 1.5-cm longitudinal incision is made at the inferior aspect of the umbilicus, then 

deepened through the subcutaneous fat to the anterior rectus sheath. The peritoneum 

is 

elevated between two straight clamps and incised so as to afford safe entry into the abdominal 

cavity. An 11-mm blunt Hasson trocar is placed into the abdominal cavity, and insufflation of 

carbon dioxide is initiated to a maximum pressure of 15 mm Hg. A 1.2-cm incision is made three 

fingerbreadths below the xiphoid process and deepened into the subcutaneous fat. An 11-mm 

trocar 

is advanced 

into the abdominal cavity under direct vision 

in the direction of the 

gallbladder 

through 

the abdominal wall. A 5-mm grasper 

is placed 

through 

the 11-mm 

subxiphoid port and applied to the fundus of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is then elevated 

over the dome of the liver to facilitate the positions for the lateral 5-mm ports. Lateral skin 

incisions are made, and two 5-mm trocars are advanced into the peritoneal cavity under direct 

vision. A 5-mm grasper with the locking mechanism is placed through each of these lateral ports. 

Due to the inflammatory reaction, all anatomical landmarks and surgical fields were lost. 

There was extensive fibrosis and scar tissue adhering the gallbladder to the liver . The 

surgeon dissected for 2 hours until he located the cystic duct and cystic artery. While dissecting 

due to lack of visualization and confirmation he lacerated the cystic artery and led to an 

arterial bleed. The procedure was converted to an open surgery and on laparotomy, the 

bleeding site was eventually identified and clamped to control the bleeding. One pint of blood 

was transfused due to the drop in blood pressure. The cystic duct was then identified and 

clamped and the gallbladder dissected and separated from the liver before being removed from 

the port. The patient was admitted to the ICU postoperatively for observation for 2 days .

and mortality. 

The 

injuries maybe 

major/catastrophic 

injuries or minor vascular 

injuries. Commonest sites 

for catastrophic 

hemorrhage are the right iliac vessels, inferior vena cava and less commonly the abdominal 

aorta. Access is associated with injuries to the gastrointestinal tract and major blood vessels and 

at least 50% of these major complications occur prior to the commencement of the intended 

surgery. The injuries commonly occur at the step of abdominal entry using a Veress needle or 

the insertion of trocars. These risks are inherent to all laparoscopic surgery. The management of 

major vascular injuries requires an open surgery/laparotomy and vascular surgeons. 2 This 

complication rate has remained the same during the past 25 years. 4 13-50% of vascular injuries 

are undiagnosed at the time of surgery. 4 The reason for these injuries is the close proximity of 

the anterior abdominal wall to the retroperitoneal vascular structures. In thin patients, this 

distance may be as little as two centimeters. The distal aorta and right common iliac artery are 

particularly prone to injury.  

Minor vascular injuries are so named since these are injuries to vessels of lesser importance 

than the aorta, inferior vena cava, and iliac vessels. However, these are by no means minor in 

nature. The most common minor vascular injury is to the inferior epigastric vessels, occurring 

in up to 2.5% of laparoscopic hernia repairs. There were 76 cases of minor vascular injuries 

involving principally the epigastric vessels in a review of 10,837 patients undergoing a hernia

","Whereas in access-related vascular injuries it is recommended to convert to open surgery in 

order to control the bleeding, vascular injuries that occur during dissection after all the ports 

have been placed may be dealt with laparoscopically. The range of appropriate measures goes 

from simple application of pressure to immediate conversion to open surgery. Obviously, the 

optimal management of an intraoperative vascular complication depends on the severity of the 

case and the experience of the surgeon. In the individual case, the surgeon must make this 

decision based upon 

the 

respective situation and must choose 

the solution 

that 

least 

compromises patient safety and the goals of the actual procedure. 4 

As in open surgery, the first step is the application of pressure to the source of the bleeding. 

Whereas in open surgery manual compression can be applied very quickly, in a laparoscopic 

case an effective tamponade requires a small laparotomy pad or at least a sponge gauze to be 

pressed onto the bleeding site via a laparoscopic instrument (e.g., a grasper). As an alternative, 

Yurkanin suggested the use of a Foley catheter that is inserted through one of the ports. The 

inflated catheter balloon can be pressed onto the bleeding site with a catheter guide (Yurkanin 

et al. 2005). Moreover, 

the 

intraabdominal pressure can be 

increased up 

to 25 mmHg 

temporarily to diminish venous bleeding. Blood pooling around the site of the lesion can then be 

aspirated and a slow retraction of the tamponade should reveal the source of the bleeding. In a 

minor vascular injury, application of pressure for a couple of minutes alone may solve the 

problem.5 

Hemostyptic agents: Agents such as oxidized regenerated cellulose, and fibrin glue may be 

applied alone or in combination. 5 

Electrocautery or harmonic scalpel: The harmonic scalpel uses a high-frequency ultrasonic 

transducer with a microprocessor-controlled generator to detect changes 

in the feedback 

acoustic pattern. Vessel coagulation is then performed in a similar method to electrosurgery by 

tamponading the vessel and then sealing with a denatured protein coagulum while using 

ultrasonic vibration to denature hydrogen bonds. 6 

Application of clips: If there is adequate exposure of the injured vessel, these techniques may 

be enough to control the bleeding. 5 

Suturing: A decision must be made as to whether the respective blood vessel has to be repaired 

or not. If a repair is not necessary, an open or a laparoscopic suture ligation is most likely to 

stop the bleeding. Suture appliers such as Lapra-ty may be used to save time.  

Hem-o-locks: The Hem-o-lok product line is an innovative ligation system that combines the 

security of a 2.0 suture with the speed of a metal clip for open and laparoscopic surgery 

Ligasure and Gyrus PK: These devices use bipolar electrical energy and pressure to melt 

collagen and elastin in vessel walls to form a seal. The former utilizes continuous energy while 

the latter uses pulsed energy. 6 

Enseal: This device uses bipolar electrical energy but employs a nanotechnology feedback 

mechanism to reduce thermal spread by changing the energy required for sealing in response to 

tissue characteristics 6 

Gel Foam: This is a Sterile Compressed Sponge intended for application to bleeding surfaces as 

a hemostatic. 7 

Floseal: The Floseal Matrix is indicated in surgical procedures as an adjunct to hemostasis 

when control of bleeding by ligature or conventional procedures is ineffective or impractical. 8

","Stapling devices: In case the injured vessel is nicely exposed, the application of a stapling 

device might also be considered. 5 

Conversion to open surgery: Endoscopic management is more likely to be feasible if a repair 

does not have to be attempted to Obtain optimal exposure: Identification of the bleeding site

can lead to salivary incontinence and changes in the muscles in and around the lips thus causing 

inability to lower the lip and aesthetic complications. Spinal accessory nerve supplies the 

trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscle thus leading to shoulder dysfunction. 1 Facial nerve 

injury can lead to a deformity causing obvious and disfiguring complications. The medicolegal 

implications and the delayed and guarded recovery of such patients leave a bad scar, not only 

on the patient but also on the surgeon. 3 

O B S E R V A T I ON 

A 45-year-old woman presented with goiter 

for 

the 

last 3 years which presented with 

compressive symptoms. Euthyroid. Access, ports, and operative space creation: Surgical access 

can be broadly classified as cervical and extra cervical routes. Within the extra cervical route, 

TA, CW, and AB approaches are more frequently practiced. It is still early days to comment on 

the superiority of one technique over the other. Usually, a 10 mm camera port and two 5 mm 

working ports are used with an additional port optionally. Irrespective of the access route, 

operative space (OS) has to be created in contrast to natural OS in the abdomen or pleural cavity. 

We create OS through a combination of blunt and sharp subcutaneous or subpectoral fascial 

dissection with long hemostats, balloon inflation, and diathermy dissection under vision (Fig. 2). 

This dissection is continued in the subplatysmal plane of the neck beyond. the clavicle. This 

latter dissection is done up to the level of the thyroid cartilage and over the ipsilateral thyroid 

lobe. Reaching thyroid gland in visceral space of neck: In ET, similar to open thyroidectomy, the 

thyroid goiter (TG) can be approached through midline between strap muscles or 

lateral 

approach between strap muscle and sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle. This lateral approach is 

especially useful in ET as it is an avascular plane, avoids anterior jugular veins, and aids in direct 

control of middle thyroid vein. With diathermy, the deep fascia over this plane is incised and 

SCM is retracted. Lateral one-third of strap muscles can be cut for extra space. Middle thyroid 

vein is controlled with clips. Mobilization of the thyroid gland: Deep-to-deep cervical fascia, the 

11/23/18 Need Specification Documents – Minimal Access Surgery

","avascular plane between thyroid lobe and carotid sheath, is further opened up till prevertebral 

fascia. Pretracheal fascia over the thyroid lobe is teased close. to TG and it is rotated medially. 

This dissection continues until the lateral part of the superior thyroid pedicle is visualized. 

Control of superior thyroid pedicle: Strap muscle overlying the TG is retracted and if needed its 

lateral one-third 

is cut. Once superior pedicle blood vessels are visualized, they must be 

skeletonized, 

teasing away 

the pretracheal 

fascia and strap muscle 

fibers with bipolar 

diathermy. The skeletonized pedicle blood vessels are 

individually double clipped on the 

proximal side and single clipped toward TG. They are divided to devascularize TG superiorly 

Control of inferior thyroid pedicle: With the combination of blunt and sharp dissection assisted 

by diathermy, the trachea below the ipsilateral isthmolobar junction is visualized. The multiple 

inferior thyroid veins (ITVs) should be skeletonized from the medial to the lateral side. ITVs are 

individually clipped and divided. Before dividing the 

lateral most ITV, it 

is mandatory to 

differentiate it from recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) as it courses parallel to them. If in doubt, 

lateral ITV should be divided after demonstration of RLN only. However, with the endoscopic 

magnification, 

it 

is not as difficult 

to differentiate 

ITV 

from RLN as 

in open surgery. 

Identification of recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN): As ET is usually performed for smaller goiters, 

RLN lies in normal location in the majority of cases. It courses in the trachea-esophageal groove 

between the branches of ITA. With endoscopic magnification, RLN is seen very clearly as a white 

string-like structure with a vasa nervosum accompanying it, posterior to TG. Low-amperage 

diathermy current is employed at least 2 mm away from RLN to divide vascular structures. RLN 

is followed up, until 

its entry at the 

lower border of the 

inferior pharyngeal constrictor. 

Parathyroid glands (PT): Thorough anatomical and embryological knowledge along with 

adequate experience in thyroid surgery is mandatory to identify PT. They should be looked for 

in 

usual 

anatomical 

locations. 

Superior PT, which 

is 

the most 

constant, 

is 

located 

posterosuperior to RLN in more than 80 % of individuals. Capsular dissection close to the 

capsule of TG with meticulous hemostasis using bipolar diathermy is done to preserve PT. 

Inferior PT is located anteroinferior to RLN over the inferior pole of the thyroid, which is 

dissected and preserved similar to superior PT. Ligament of Berry: Division of posterior 

suspensory ligament of thyroid also known as ligament of Berry is the penultimate step of ET. 

After identification of RLN over its entire course, the ligament of Berry has divided close to TG 

and away from RLN using bipolar diathermy, as it is a vascular structure. Separation of TG from 

thyroid bed: The only attachment of TG in the neck after prior steps is flimsy, hypovascular 

areolar tissue between TG and tracheal perichondrium. It is dissected with sharp dissection 

using scissors after the elevation of TG off the trachea. Postoperatively the patient presented 

acute respiratory distress and was diagnosed with unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. 

She was admitted to the ICU and started on systemic corticosteroids 

T H E PRO B L EM  

Thyroid surgery is the most common cause of recurrent nerve (RLN) injury and gives a rate 

approaching 5% in a large series with close follow-up. These complications are probably more 

common in revision neck surgery. The course of the RLN frequently varies despite normal 

anatomy or as a consequence of congenital vascular anomalies or distortion of regional anatomy 

by extension of goiter by neoplasm or inflammation. When approaching the inferior pole of the 

11/23/18 Need Specification Documents – Minimal Access Surgery 

46 

 
 
 
 
 
","gland, the RLN may be traversed by the ITA (inferior thyroid artery) or may pass between the 

arterial ramifications. Deliberate identification of the RLN minimizes the risk of injury. When 

the nerve is identified and dissected, the reported RLN injury rate during thyroidectomy is 0 -

2.1%. This rate is reportedly higher if surgery is repeated (2- 12%) or if the nerve is not clearly 

identified 

(4-6.6%). 

4 Unilateral RLN 

injury 

can 

cause varying degrees of hoarseness, 

microaspiration, coughing and other symptoms, and bilateral RLN injuries may induce aphonia, 

dyspnea, and even asphyxia to threaten the life of the patients. 

Facial nerve injury is a feared complication of parotidectomy. Facial nerve paralysis can cause 

cosmetic and functional morbidity, ocular complications, diminished quality of life , and medical 

malpractice litigation.1,2 Temporary facial nerve dysfunction occurs in 20% to 40% of patients 

undergoing parotidectomy, whereas permanent facial nerve dysfunction is uncommon and 

occurs 

in 0% to 4% of patients. Even the most experienced surgeon may have difficulty 

identifying and preserving cranial nerves. 

5 

 Oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures 

accounted for 40% of injuries, resections of head and neck lesions 25%, otologic procedures 

17%, cosmetic procedures 11%, and other procedures 7%. 6  There are numerous factors that 

may influence facial nerve injury during parotidectomy, including tumor size, type, location, 

extent of surgery, 

inflammation, and reoperation. Facial nerve 

injury mechanisms during 

parotidectomy include nerve division, stretch, compression, ligature entrapment, thermal and 

electrical injuries, and ischemia. The surgeon has control over most of these mechanisms of 

facial nerve 

injury, and proper, a safe surgical 

technique 

is paramount 

for 

facial nerve 

preservation. 5 

One should also consider the possibility of any thermal injury, either due to the cautery or the 

burr as a source of injury, if he feels that the nerve is intact anatomically. A remote possibility of 

Bell's palsy should also be considered but only as a diagnosis of exclusion. 

With the advent of high-quality microscopes and nerve monitors, the chances of iatrogenic 

facial nerve palsy have come down dramatically but complications still occur leading to poor 

surgical outcomes and medico-legal cases.

CURRENT METHODS USED FOR PREVENT ION NERVE TRAUMA INTRAOPERAT IV ELY 

The risk of inadvertent nerve trauma due to accidental transection or heat-related injury may 

be minimized by the following means:  

Surgical Technique: For 

facial nerve antegrade 

technique or 

retrograde 

technique or 

combination of techniques may be used to avoid injury to the nerves. 9 

Nerve monitoring: This is an adjunctive method that a surgeon can choose to use during 

surgery to assist with the functional preservation of a motor nerve or nerves. Facial nerve 

monitoring is widely used in otologic, neurotologic, and skull base surgery. Improvement in the 

functional preservation of the facial nerve with facial nerve monitoring in acoustic neuroma 

surgery and its cost-effectiveness in otologic surgery has been demonstrated. It is also used in 

parotid surgeries. The goals of facial nerve monitoring during parotidectomy are the same as 

those during otologic and neurotologic surgery and include early facial nerve identification, 

warning to the surgeon of unexpected facial nerve stimulation, mapping of the course of the 

nerve, reduction of mechanical trauma to the nerve, and evaluation and prognosis of nerve 

function at the conclusion of the procedure. 5 

Monitoring methods:  

1. Visual Monitoring: One approach 

is to visually monitor for facial movements during 

surgery. With this method, an assistant alerts the surgeon to facial movements that are 

evoked electrically with a nerve stimulator or evoked mechanically during surgical 

dissection. 5 

2. Electrophysiological monitoring: This is another more sophisticated method of facial 

nerve monitoring. With this approach, facial muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity is 

monitored by an electrophysiologist or by the surgical team during surgery. Several 

electrophysiologic nerve monitoring systems are commercially available, including the NIM-

Response 2.0 Nerve Integrity Monitor (NIM-2; Medtronic Xomed, Jacksonville, FL), the 

Neurosign 400 (Magstim Co., Ltd, Whitland, South West Wales, UK), and the Viking II–EMG 

11/23/18 Need Specification Documents – Minimal Access Surgery 

48 

 
 
 
 
 
","System (Nicolet Biomedical, Madison, WI). These multichannel systems continuously track 

facial muscle activity during surgery and have a built-in pulse generator for electrically 

evoked EMG responses. Electrophysiologic monitoring is generally the preferred method of 

facial nerve monitoring because it is more sensitive and specific than visual monitoring of 

facial movements. Intraoperatively, the surgeon or the neurophysiologist performing the 

monitoring must differentiate true EMG events from artifacts such as those that occur from 

contact between surgical instruments in the operative field. EMG waveform characteristics, 

EMG amplitude, and the surgical context of the event aid in this differentiation. A false-

positive event should be excluded because this may give the surgeon a false sense of 

insecurity. It must be emphasized that the absence of an electrically evoked response does 

not exclude the possibility that the stimulated tissue is the facial nerve. Electrosurgical units 

and other electrical equipment can create an electrical artifact that interferes with facial 

muscle response recording. 5 

Intraoperative neuromonitoring of RLN has brought the following benefits: significantly 

reducing 

iatrogenic RLN 

injury, 

increasing the scope of surgical safety, 

improving the 

identification rate of RLN, accelerating the intraoperative RLN identification and reducing 

accidental injury 

Electrode stimulations for RLN and Superior laryngeal nerve: Recording electrodes are 

positioned to monitor both the right and left vocal folds. An identical fine silver wire 

electrode is used, applied to the vocal folds. The RLN is stimulated by the application of a 

unipolar brass probe to deliver an electric current that ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 mA at a 

frequency of 30 Hz. The identity of an intact RLN would be confirmed through a series of 

audible acoustic signals that were generated by the machine and an action potential traced 

on a monitor screen. The functional integrity of the nerve once again should be confirmed at 

the end of the thyroidectomy by the testing of the most proximal exposed portion of the 

nerve.  

3. Pulsed Infrared Optical Radiation: Facial nerve monitoring equipment of the future will 

likely be more refined. A recent report describes optical nerve stimulation using pulsed 

infrared optical radiation. This new method may contribute 

to 

the 

improved spatial 

selectivity of stimulation. 5 

4. Modalities used in other surgical fields: In a study among Patients undergoing surgical 

fixation following acetabular or pelvic fracture, they had Neuromonitoring during surgery 

performed using three different modalities, transcranial electric motor evoked potential 

(tceMEP), somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP), and electromyographic (EMG) 

monitoring.  tceMEP monitoring was found to be 100% sensitive and 86% specific at 

detecting an impending nerve injury. The sensitivity and specificity of SSEP were 75% and 

94%, while EMG sensitivity was unacceptably low at 20% although specificity was 93%. 10

Facial Nerve: Once there is iatrogenic facial paralysis, it is recommended to re-explore as early 

as possible, provided adequate facilities (experienced otologist and well-equipped operation 

theater) are available. Facial nerve exploration surgery is often necessary to restore facial nerve 

functions. The indications and the timing of exploration surgery are sometimes controversial. In 

general, facial nerve exploration by means of decompression with or without restoration of the 

continuity of the nerve is performed when there is immediate complete facial nerve injury after 

mastoidectomy or parotid surgery. However, when the palsy is incomplete, a wait -and -see 

policy is generally indicated. The final results depend on the extent of the injury. If there is a 

total transaction with gap requiring cable nerve grafting, then the results are less than optimum, 

with significant synkinesis. A greater auricular nerve graft may be done, because of its close 

proximity to the operative site and because of ease of harvesting. If anatomical continuity is 

maintained, the results are good with minimum synkinesis. 3, 11 

Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve: The treatment methods include the medicines (neurotrophic 

medicines, glucocorticoids and vasodilators); ultrashort wave 

therapy, acupuncture and 

moxibustion and others; voice training, vocal cord injection and others; reinnervation methods

Chronic liver disease is prevalent worldwide irrespective of age, sex, region or race. Cirrhosis is 

an end result of a variety of liver diseases characterized by fibrosis and architectural distortion 

of the liver and can have varied clinical manifestations and complications. According to WHO, 

about 46% of global diseases and 59% of the mortality is because of chronic diseases and 

almost 35 million people in the world die of chronic diseases. Liver disease rates are steadily 

increasing over the years. 1 

Global prevalence of cirrhosis from autopsy studies ranges from 4.5% to 9.5% of the general 

population that would equate to more than 50 million people in the world. Globally, alcohol, 

NASH, and viral hepatitis currently are the most common causative factors. Prevalence of 

cirrhosis is likely to be underestimated as almost a third of the patients remain asymptomatic.. 

Deaths from cirrhosis have been estimated to increase and would make it as the 12th leading 

cause of death in 2020. 1 

Gastroesophageal varices are the most relevant portosystemic collaterals because of their 

rupture results in variceal hemorrhage, the most common lethal complication of cirrhosis. 

Gastroesophageal varices are present in approximately 50% of patients with cirrhosis. Their 

presence correlates with the severity of liver disease. 2 

Patients without varices develop them at a rate of 8% per year. Variceal hemorrhage occurs at a 

yearly rate of 5–15% and the most important predictor of hemorrhage is the size of varices, 

with the highest risk of first hemorrhage (15% per year) occurring in patients with large varices. 

Although bleeding from esophageal varices ceases spontaneously in up to 40% of patients, and 

despite improvements in therapy over the last decade, it is associated with a mortali ty of at 

least 20% at 6 weeks. 

O B S E R V A T I ON 

A 45-year-old female who was a known case of hepatitis C presented with melena (blood in 

stools) and 3 episodes of haematemesis (blood in vomitus) for one day. She had mild distention 

& diffuse tenderness of the abdomen. The patient was diagnosed with Decompensated liver 

disease with upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to ruptured esophageal varices. A 

large 

quantity of blood was drained through her nasogastric tube on lavage. The blood pressure was 

100/50 and the pulse rate was 130 beats per minute despite IV fluid replacement and blood 

transfusion was advised. The patient was transfused with 3 pints of blood and was shifted for 

emergency variceal banding. Variceal banding was attempted and 3 bands were applied but 

were eventually discarded due to excessive bleeding due to lack of visibility and sclerotherapy 

was done instead. Following sclerotherapy, an esophageal ulcer developed post-op supposedly 

due to mucosal involvement during banding.

","Current 

therapies 

for 

the management 

of 

varices/variceal hemorrhage 

are multifold. 

Pharmacological therapy consists of splanchnic vasoconstrictors (vasopressin and analogues, 

somatostatin and analogues, nonselective β-blockers) and vasodilators (nitrates) which help in 

reducing the size of varices. 2 

However, 

acute 

esophageal 

variceal bleeding 

is 

an 

intractable 

complication of portal 

hypertension. Endoscopic therapies, such as sclerotherapy or endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL), 

are local therapies that have no effect on either portal flow or resistance. Shunting therapy, 

either radiological (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) or surgical, by bypassing the 

site of increased resistance, markedly reduces portal pressure by bypassing the site of increased 

resistance. 2 

Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) has been gradually applied to the management of 

esophageal variceal bleeding since the mid-1970s. EIS performed as the first effective measure 

proved to be superior to vasoconstrictors or balloon tamponade 

in the control of acute 

esophageal variceal bleeding. However, EIS is associated with some complications such as 

adverse pulmonary and renal effects, esophageal ulceration, stricture, perforation, and death. 

Complications occur in up to 40% of patients, and treatment-related death in 1% to 2%. 3 

Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) was introduced in 1986 and is now considered the treatment 

of choice for esophageal variceal bleeding. EVL requires placement of an opaque cylinder in 

front of the endoscope, rubber bands are placed around varices through the flexible endoscope 

which 

is used to visualize the vessels. This therapy 

is affected by the endoscopic vision. 

Visualization is very important for treatment in a patient with esophageal variceal bleeding, and 

maybe more impaired when treating by EVL.  In theory, this purely mechanical method of 

obliterating varices should produce no systemic sequelae, and since the quantity of tissue 

ligated is limited by the design of the device, it should also result in few complications involving 

the esophageal wall. The 

incidence of complications, such as pneumonia and esophageal 

stricture is low. Now EVL has been gradually adopted to substitute for EIS in the treatment of 

esophageal variceal bleeding. 3 

However re-bleeding rate in both procedures in high, The overall rebleeding rate in the EVL 

group of these studies was 21.7%, while the rebleeding rate in the EIS group was 33.1%. 3

Epidemiology: 

 The Global prevalence of Cirrhosis ranges between 4.5 -9.5%.1 Using an 

average of the two figures and considering an Indian population of 1,300,000,000 we could 

assume 

that 

the probable prevalence of 

cirrhosis due 

to any 

causes 

is 91,000,000. 

Gastroesophageal varices are present in approximately 50% of patients with cirrhosis according 

to guidelines by the American College of Gastroenterology which we could use to infer that  

45,500,000 Indians have varices and are at risk of developing active variceal bleeding.2 The ACG 

also mentions that variceal hemorrhage occurs at a yearly rate of 5–15%.2 Using an average of 

10% that would mean that there are approximately 4,550,000 cases in any given year in India. 

Most of 

these patients would require pharmacological and/or endoscopic management. 

However re-bleeding rate in these procedures in high, The overall rebleeding rate in the EVL is 

21.7%, while the rebleeding rate in the EIS group is 33.1% according to a meta-analysis.3  

In an 11 center city in India, Mukerjee et. al. found that  1.28% of all patients attending the 

eleven participating hospitals of India had

Preventive Measures 2 

 

Screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD): EGD is recommended for the diagnosis 

of esophageal and gastric varices is recommended when the diagnosis of cirrhosis is made. 

Size of the of varices and the presence or absence of red signs (red wale marks or red spots) 

on varices should be noted. 

 

Pharmaceutical: Beta-blockers may be used   

Management of Active Variceal bleeding 2 

 

Supportive therapy: Acute GI hemorrhage in a patient with cirrhosis is an emergency that 

requires prompt attention with intravascular volume support and blood transfusions, being 

careful to maintain a hemoglobin of ~8 g/dL 

 

Pharmacological 

therapy: Somatostatin or 

its analogues octreotide and vapreotide; 

terlipressin should be initiated as soon as variceal hemorrhage is suspected and continued 

for 3–5 days after diagnosis is confirmed. 

 

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD): EGD is performed within 12 hours and used to 

make a diagnosis as well as to treat variceal hemorrhage, either with endoscopic variceal 

ligation or injection sclerotherapy. 

 

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS): TIPS is indicated in patients in 

whom hemorrhage from esophageal varices cannot be controlled or in whom bleeding 

recurs despite combined pharmacological and endoscopic therapy 

 

Balloon tamponade: This should be used as a temporizing measure (maximum 24 hours) 

in patients with uncontrollable bleeding for whom a more definitive therapy (e.g., TIPS or 

endoscopic therapy) is planned 

Combination of pharmacological therapy and endoscopic therapy is the most rational approach 

in the treatment of acute variceal hemorrhage. The use of pharmacological agents with few side 

effects allows prolonging therapy to 5 days, the period during which the risk of rebleeding is the

Bowel injury is the third cause of death from a laparoscopic procedure after major vascular 

injury and anesthesia.  Unlike major vascular injuries where the risk and presentation are 

immediate, many bowel injuries go unrecognized at the time of the procedure. 1 

Overall, bowel injury is a rare complication of laparoscopic surgery. In a recent retrospective 

analysis of 13 laparoscopic series in general surgery, gynecology, and urology, 266 bowel 

complications occurred in a total of 205,969 cases. This corresponds to a combined incidence of 

0.13%. However, gynecologic procedures accounted for more than 50% and urologic cases for 

only 0.44% of the total volume of this review. In the urologic literature, slightly higher incidence 

rates between 0.2% and 1.3% are reported. This fact is most likely attributable to the higher 

number of complex surgical cases (e.g., 

laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, 

laparoscopic 

RPLND) included in the urologic series. The most commonly injured part of the intestine is the 

small bowel followed by the colon and the rarely injured stomach. Injuries of the duodenum are 

the most serious bowel complications of laparoscopic surgery as they are associated with the 

highest morbidity and mortality rates. 2 

Inadvertent enterotomy potentially 

is a 

lethal complication of 

laparoscopic surgery. Even 

though no deaths were reported at our institution, death from inadvertent enterotomy is not 

uncommon. Van der Voort et al found that the mortality rate associated with intestinal injury 

during laparoscopy was 3.6%. 3

A 50 year male with a renal mass in the left kidney. Initial pneumoperitoneum achieved at the 

umbilicus. The initial 10-mm trocar is placed under vision at or near the umbilicus. Subsequent 

trocars placed under vision with the 10-mm laparoscope in the umbilical trocar. A 5- to 12-mm 

trocar placed lateral to the umbilical port at the edge of the left rectus abdominus muscle. 

Finally, a 

third 5-mm 

trocar

the xiphoid and 

the umbilicus. 

Mobilization of colon and peritoneum. Plane bluntly dissected by dividing 

the colorenal 

ligaments. Duodenum rolled medially to identify the inferior vena cava. Ureter and gonadal vein 

identified and both the lower pole of the kidney and the renal hilum identified. The lower pole 

dissection was performed. After ureter and gonadal vein were secured and the inferior pole of 

the kidney is dissected the renal hilar was dissected. The plane between the adrenal gland and 

the superior pole of the kidney were bluntly dissected. The ureter was divided. During 

dissection, the small bowel was damaged with the cautery and the procedure was converted to 

an open procedure for closure of the bowel injury. The patient remained in the ward without 

incident before being discharged on post-op day 8 

T H E PRO B L EM  

Early recognition is very 

important for all types of 

laparoscopic complications, for bowel 

injuries, however, it is probably most crucial. In this case, a time delay can turn a minor

","intraoperative problem into a life-threatening condition. Roughly two out of three intestinal 

lesions that occur during laparoscopy are only diagnosed postoperatively and up to one out of 

four patients with delayed presentation of a bowel lesion dies as a result of the complication. 2 

The bowel can basically be harmed by any kind of sharp or blunt instrument. Given the limited 

field of view inherent to laparoscopic surgery, such an injury can easily go unnoticed.  

Entry into the abdomen itself can cause injuries. A large survey of nearly 37,000 gynecologic 

laparoscopies in the US revealed a 0.16% incidence of bowel injury. 39.8% of vascular and 

intestinal injuries were caused by the Veress needle, 37.9% by insertion of the primary trocar 

and 22% by the insertion of the secondary trocar. 1 

Manipulation with instruments outside this field (e.g., during instrument changes) is prone to 

an inadvertent violation of bowel and other intraabdominal structures. If a lesion cannot be 

seen directly, free intestinal contents are proof of a bowel laceration. Additionally, the escape of 

a fecal smell through an opened port valve must lead to a search for a bowel injury. If such a 

lesion is strongly suspected, the whole bowel has to be inspected meticulously, since moving 

small bowel 

loops and the greater omentum tends to hide an intestinal 

lesion. Even the 

spontaneous temporary closure of such defects has been reported. Furthermore, the possibility 

of two or more concomitant injuries has to be taken into consideration. Electrocautery-induced 

thermal damage is the single most frequent origin of bowel injury during laparoscopic surgery. 

In a review article, this form accounted for 50% of all bowel lesions. Typically, this injury is 

missed intraoperatively because of the delayed breakdown of the intestinal wall. So again it is 

the surgeon's knowledge of possible mechanisms of electrosurgical injury combined with a high 

index of suspicion throughout the entire procedure that can lead to the detection of as yet 

invisible bowel lesions. The four mechanisms of electrocautery-induced thermal damage during 

laparoscopic surgery are 

inappropriate direct activation of the electrocautery, coupling to 

another instrument, insulation failure, and capacitive coupling. The typical situation where 

capacitive 

coupling 

can occur 

is when an 

insulated active electrode 

(e.g., monopolar 

laparoscopic scissors) is introduced through a metal cannula. Through an electrostatic field that 

is created between the active electrode and the cannula, the current in the electrode can induce 

a current in the cannula. 2

CURRENT METHODS USED FOR PREVENT ION OF IN C IDENTAL ENTEROSTOMY 

Prevention of bowel injuries during urologic laparoscopic surgery seems to be difficult since 

experienced laparoscopic surgeons are reported to cause an equal rate of intraoperative bowel 

lesions as inexperienced surgeons.  

Pre-operative preparations: Routine use of a nasogastric tube to empty the stomach reduces 

the risk of injury to the stomach. Also, preoperative bowel preparation may reduce inadvertent 

intestinal 

trauma by 

increasing 

intraperitoneal 

free 

space and by 

facilitating operative 

maneuvers.  

Abdominal entry: Especially for the inexperienced laparoscopic surgeon and assistant, it is 

advisable to introduce any new instrument under direct visual control in order to prevent 

inadvertent bowel injury outside the field of view. Likewise, a laparoscopic instrument that is 

not in use must always be removed from the patient.  

Electrothermal trauma: All laparoscopic instruments must be checked for insulation damage 

prior to their use. Bipolar electrocautery should be used whenever possible and all diathermy 

must be avoided close to the bowel. Monopolar electrocautery should not be used to take down 

bowel adhesions. The lowest possible power setting should be used at all times. The electric 

energy should only be activated when the entire active part of the instrument is visualized and 

the tip of the instrument is in contact with the target. To prevent duodenal injury in right-sided 

renal or adrenal procedures, the medial reflection of the duodenum by the Kocher maneuver 

must be performed using blunt and sharp dissection only. The use of thermal energy must be 

strictly avoided during this step of the procedure.  

Innovative instruments: Devices such as Ligasure, which uses a high-current low-voltage 

output, or the Harmonic Scalpel, which uses ultrasonic energy for both cutting and coagulation, 

minimize the spread of thermal energy and thereby may reduce the risk of inadvertent bowel 

injury. 

High-risk patients: Extensive adhesiolysis must be considered an advanced 

laparoscopic 

procedure and it should, therefore, remain in the hands of the experienced endoscopic surgeon. 

Alternatively, 

in 

patients with 

prior 

abdominal 

surgery 

and/or 

radiation 

therapy, 

a 

retroperitoneoscopic 

approach may 

be 

considered. 

It 

has 

recently 

been 

shown 

that 

retroperitoneoscopic renal and adrenal surgery can be performed in these patients without

","increasing 

the perioperative morbidity 

or 

the 

convalescence. However, 

intraoperative 

orientation can be very difficult in case a surgeon is unfamiliar with retroperitoneoscopy and 

bowel complications have also been reported with this approach. In a prospective randomized 

comparison of transperitoneal vs 

laparoscopic radical nephrectomy in the general patient 

population, no significant difference in bowel complications was found. 

M AN AG EM EN T O F IN C ID E N T A L EN T E RO S T OM Y   

Once 

an 

intestinal 

injury 

is 

recognized 

intraoperatively, 

it 

can 

be 

safely managed 

laparoscopically in most cases. However, if there is any question as to the integrity of the repair 

or if the patient had prior radiation therapy, open repair and consultation of a general surgeon 

should be considered. The laceration should be oversewn in one or two layers if small bowel is 

involved. Lesions of the colon and the rectum should always be closed in two layers. In simple 

lesions, it is usually not necessary to resect the injured bowel segment. It is advisable to 

oversew also small serosal abrasions since these minor lesions can cause major postoperative 

complications if they are left unattended during the initial laparoscopic procedure. Immediate 

repair of a bowel injury does not require intestinal diversion even if the rectum is involved, and 

it usually does not have a significant impact on the postoperative course and the length of 

hospital stay. 

The management of electrothermal injuries of the bowel differs to some extent from the 

management of simple lacerations. If a thermal injury is caused by bipolar electrocautery, it may 

be excised and the bowel wall defect may be simply closed as long as the lesion is small in 

diameter. 

If more than half of the circumference of the bowel segment 

is 

involved, the 

respective segment needs to be resected and an end-to-end anastomosis should be performed. 

In injuries that are caused by monopolar electrocautery, on the other hand, the extension of the 

tissue damage is typically underestimated. Therefore, any monopolar electrothermal lesion 

necessitates resection and end-to-end anastomosis of the involved bowel segment. Additionally, 

a safety margin of several centimeters on either side of the injury should be resected before the 

completion of the end-to-end anastomosis. 

Again, all these steps may be performed laparoscopically by the highly experienced endoscopic 

surgeon. Considering the high morbidity of postoperative intestinal complications, a surgeon 

who does not feel absolutely confident with advanced laparoscopic bowel surgery is strongly 

advised to convert to an open procedure or consult a general surgeon. 2
