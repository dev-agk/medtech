These unmet clinical needs were identified following an 8-week clinical immersion that was 

conducted by a team in Neurology and Neurosurgery. The clinical immersion was conducted in 

high volume tertiary care centers in South India. We observed what's done and how it affects 

the provider, the patient, and the system. This was followed by a peripheral immersion to 

numerous primary, secondary and tertiary health care centers across India. The clinical needs 

found in the tertiary care hospital were validated in other large centers and new primary and 

secondary specific unmet needs were added on. At the end of 2 months of clinical immersion, 

the team had over 30 detailed observations with significant negative outcomes and 40 unmet 

clinical needs. These needs were then filtered using objective parameters, detailed below:

NEUROLOGY & NEUROSURGERY 

1. VENTILATOR-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA 

BACKGROUND 

Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) 

is a 

lung 

infection caused due to a patient being 

ventilated on a mechanical ventilator 1. Typically this occurs in cases of long-term ventilated 

patients. Long-term can be as short as 3-4 days or even after 3-4 weeks of being on a ventilator. 

There are several causes of VAP including poor immunity of the patient, oral secretions trickling 

down the trachea, poor patient hygiene etc. VAP is one of the most common Hospital Acquired 

Infections (HAI) and accounts for more than half of all Hospital-acquired Pneumonia infections. 

2 This increases the patient’s stay at the hospital and delays recovery and rehabilitation. Several 

patients die annually from VAP in India which is commonly caused by multidrug-resistant 

organisms.   

OBSERVATION 

Presentation 

A 41-year-old male came into the Neuro-emergency ward of a tertiary care hospital in an 

ambulance after being involved in a road traffic accident. There was no external bleeding.  

History 

The patient had no history of Hypertension, Diabetes, or any other co-morbidity. 

Treatment 

An emergency CT scan revealed an epidural hematoma that was causing compression on the 

brain. There was a slight mid-line shift. The patient’s Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 

11/15. The patient was taken for a Decompression surgery via Craniotomy. The hematoma was 

successfully evacuated. 

 Due to poor respiratory effort post-surgery, the patient had to be 

intubated and was put on mechanical ventilation. The neurosurgeon said 

that 

the poor 

respiratory effort was due to pulmonary edema secondary to Trauma Brain Injury (TBI). The 

patient was put on prophylactic antibiotics due to an External Ventricular Drain (EVD) catheter 

that was inserted to lower increased intra-cranial pressure.  

On Post-op day 7 (POD7), the patient contracted Pneumonia (VAP). Sputum cultures were sent 

to labs for culture sensitivity tests. Labs came positive for Pseudomonas infection. The patient 

had to be put on stronger antibiotics because the infection had developed antibiotic resistance.

","The infection took 13 days to completely clear out. The patient was extremely weak and could 

barely move his hands or 

legs. The patient was put on Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) 

Prophylaxis. 

On POD14, the patient developed Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). Cultures came positive for E. coli 

infection. The patient was put on further antibiotics (Fosfomycin) for treating the UTI.  

Until POD23, the patient was on the ventilator. Patient's postoperative (post-op) GCS was 9/15 

(with minor fluctuations) until POD21. GCS was checked when the patient was vacated from 

sedation daily to assess for extubation. The patient’s respiratory effort was gradually improving 

and the brain inflammation was slowing reducing.  

Patient’s GCS started declining on POD22 morning to 8/15. Although the patient could breathe 

by himself, the secondary brain damage had led to hypoxia in certain parts of the brain. MRI 

revealed hypoxia in several parts of the brain. The patient's GCS dropped to 6/15 by evening. 

Doctors had given up hope of reviving the patient due to severe secondary injury. The patient 

died on POD22 night.  

THE PROBLEM 

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is pneumonia that develops 48 hours or longer after 

admission to a hospital. HAP is the second most common nosocomial infection. HAP increases a 

patient's hospital stay by approximately 7-9 days and can increase hospital costs by an average 

of $40,000 per patient. 1,2 

Ventilator associated pneumonia is one such HAP. The diagnostic triad for VAP consists of the 

following clinical criteria: Pulmonary infection, bacteriologic evidence of pulmonary infection 

and radiologic suggestion of pulmonary infection. When the combination of radiologic infiltrates 

and 2 clinical criteria are observed, the sensitivity of diagnosing VAP is 69% and the specificity 

is 75%. VAP is commonly associated with multidrug-resistant pathogens. The risk factors for 

developing a resistant infection include: Hospitalization admission of greater than 5 days, 

hospital admission more than 2 days in the preceding 90 days, antibiotic use in the previous 90 

days, residence in a nursing home or extended-care facility, home infusion therapy and wound 

care, 

long-term dialysis within 30 days and 

immunocompromised. Ventilator Associated 

Pneumonia (VAP) is currently prevented by following the ventilator bundle 3. The bundle 

involves elevation of the patient’s head to 30-45 degrees, assessment of readiness to extubate, 

peptic ulcer prophylaxis and deep vein 

thrombosis 

(DVT) prophylaxis. 

In addition, 

the 

dedicated ICU nurse periodically suctions the subglottic and oropharynx region and also does 

an oral lavage with chlorhexidine (disinfectant). Studies have shown that the ventilator bundle 

has reduced the incidence of VAP cases. However, in spite of this prophylactic management, a 

large number of patient’s still contract VAP due to an ineffective protocol.

patients at THCs to prevent prolonged stay at hospital or death

MARKET POTENTIAL  

India has an incidence of around 30 VAP infections per 1000 ventilator days. More than 3 lakh 

people die annually from VAP and related complications. 3, 4 VAP occurs in 9-27% of all 

mechanically ventilated patients. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a complication in as 

many as 28% of patients who receive mechanical ventilation. The incidence of VAP increases 

with the duration of mechanical ventilation. Estimated rates are 3% per day for the first 5 days, 

2% per day for days 6-10, and 1% per day after day 10. The crude mortality rate for VAP is 27-

76%. 1  

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 

VAP is prevented by minimizing the patient’s exposition to bacteria. This involves 

maintaining a sterile environment around the patient in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). 

Adherence to the VAP bundle protocol, along with regular oral and larynx disinfection 

using chlorhexidine. 1 

AVAILABLE OPTIONS 

● 

Ventilator bundle – This comprises of 4 main actions that are taken to prevent 

Pneumonia.  

1. 

Elevation of the head to 30-45 degrees – The top half of the body is inclined to 

this angle so that the patient’s trachea and oesophagus are inclined and hence 

help the secretions flowing down the pharynx to enter the oesophagus, instead 

of entering the trachea. 

2. 

Sedation vacation and assessment of readiness to extubate – The patient 

is 

vacated from sedation and respiratory effort is checked. If the respiratory effort 

is adequate, the patient is extubated. 

3. 

Peptic Ulcer Prophylaxis – The patient is normally put on proton pump inhibitors 

to reduce the acid production 

in the stomach. The acid reflux can 

lead to 

pulmonary aspiration and can cause Pneumonia. 

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis – Long-term intubated patients are at 

high risk for developing DVT. This can lead to a Pulmonary Embolism (PE).

","2. INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE MONITORING 

BACKGROUND 

Elevated 

intracranial pressure (ICP) 

is seen 

in various conditions such as head 

trauma, 

hydrocephalus, 

intracranial hemorrhage, 

subarachnoid hemorrhage, 

intracranial 

tumors, 

hepatic encephalopathy, and cerebral edema. Elevated ICP can lead to death or devastating 

neurological damage either by reducing the perfusion of essential oxygen and nutrients to the 

brain also known as reduced cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) or by compressing of vital 

structures in the brain and brainstem. Prompt recognition is crucial in order to intervene 

appropriately. Intractable high ICP is also the most common ""terminal event"" leading to death in 

neurosurgical patients. The association between the severity of intracranial hypertension and 

poor outcome after severe head injury is well recognized. Outcomes tend to be good in patients 

with normal ICP, whereas those with elevated ICP are much more likely to have an unfavorable 

outcome. Elevated ICP carries a mortality rate of around 20%. The rapid recognition of elevated 

ICP is therefore of obvious and paramount importance so that it can be monitored and so that 

therapies directed at lowering ICP can be initiated. A raised ICP is measurable both clini cally 

and quantitatively. Continuous ICP monitoring is important both for assessing the efficacy of 

therapeutic measures and for evaluating the evolution of brain injury. 1 

OBSERVATION 

Presentation 

A 42-year-old male came into the Neuro-emergency ward of a government tertiary care hospital 

in an ambulance after being involved in a road traffic accident. There was no external bleeding. 

History 

The patient had a history of hypertension for 1 year and was on medication for the same. 

Treatment 

The patient’s GCS was 10/15. A CT scan was immediately done which revealed a left -sided 

subdural hematoma with midline shift. The patient was rushed to the Operation Theatre (OT) 

and the hematoma was evacuated. There was severe Edema and the brain had swol len. An 

External Ventricular Drain (EVD) catheter was placed in the left ventricle and the patient was 

monitored in the post-op ICU. The EVD was connected to an ICP monitor which revealed that 

the patient's ICP was 45 mmHg. The patient was put on Mannitol to manage the edema. 

The disposable ventricular catheter needed to be changed every 7 days due to the high risk of 

infection. Nearly 20% of all patients with 

ICP monitors contract 

infection 

that 

leads to 

ventriculitis or even encephalitis. The catheter with ICP monitoring capability costs INR.50,000. 

Due to the high cost, it takes the government time to procure large numbers of these catheters. 

The hospital did not have a replacement catheter and had to remove the EVD after 7 days. The 

patient’s GCS was still 11/15 and there was still cerebral edema as indicated by the CT scan

","done every 2-3 days. The patient’s ICP was now being estimated based on GCS only. On Post-op 

day 9 (POD9), the patient’s GCS fell to 9/15. A CT scan revealed a fluid-filled compartment in the 

subdural space. Another emergency surgery had to be done to evacuate the fluid and find the 

source of the fluid. The surgeon said the fluid was a collection of Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 

edematous fluid.  

POD2 the patient's GCS was 11/15 and holding. The doctor said that GCS and vital parameters 

are the only ways of estimating ICP. 

THE PROBLEM 

External Ventricular Drains (EVD) are expensive, costing up to INR.50,000. In addition, this 

drain has to be changed by a neurosurgeon every three to seven days due to the high risk of 

infection 2. Doctors have tried re-sterilizing the used EVD, however, there is a high risk of 

contracting Prions Disease. CT/MRI scans give an accurate indication of significantly increased 

ICP; however, this is not a reliable way to continuously monitor ICP. It is also expensive for 

many patients to afford a CT scan on a daily basis. An EVD is placed blindly using standard 

anatomical landmarks in the brain. There is no real-time feedback as to whether the catheter tip 

is inside the lateral ventricle. There can also be bleeding along the EVD insertion tract which can 

lead to subdural or epidural bleeds which may even require surgical management.  

Lumbar Punctures (LP) also come with risks of brain herniation and infection if the needle is 

left in situ for several days. Patient mobility becomes almost impossible.

An affordable, safer and continuous way to monitor ICP in patients at THCs to prevent the high 

risk of infection, permanent brain damage and seizures.

times, it is too late to act after GCS values drop.  

AVAILABLE OPTIONS FOR MONITORING INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE  

● 

Clinical examination: This is the most important tool for diagnosing potential elevation 

of ICP and monitoring its progression is the clinical neurological examination. Despite 

medical advances, clinical observation has not 

lost 

its 

importance 

in the ongoing 

monitoring of a patient's condition. The patient should be evaluated for the following: 

Headache, nausea, and vomiting, Degree of alertness or consciousness (Glasgow coma 

score), language comprehension, repetition, fluency, articulation; Pupillary reactivity; 

Extraocular movements and visual; Vital signs (Cushing triad: respiratory depression, 

hypertension, bradycardia); Gag or cough reflex and response to noxious stimuli 

● 

Funduscopic examination: This also remains the criterion standard in the evaluation 

of increased ICP. careful attention to the optic nerve can prove useful for evaluating the 

ICP. The optic nerve is surrounded by subarachnoid space and experiences pressure 

changes in the same way that the intracranial compartment does. 

● 

Ventriculostomy – This is a surgery wherein a Ventricular Catheter is placed in the 

lateral ventricle via the Kocher's point. An EVD is connected to the Catheter to drain out 

excess CSF to control ICP within normal limits. An EVD needs to be changed every 7-10 

days due to high risk of infection. 

● 

Lumbar Puncture (LP) / Spinal Tap – A long needle is inserted typically in the L2-L3 

space of the spine and a tap is established with the subarachnoid space. A manometer is 

then connected to the same to measure ICP. This is useful when only small quantit ies of 

Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) need to be drained. 

● 

Glasgow Coma Scale – Although this is not the recommended standard of care, this is 

often used on government hospitals when EVD Catheters are not available. A score is 

given based on the patient's eye movement, verbal response, and motor response. A 

score of less than 9/15 requires emergency medical attention. 3 

● MRI/CT Scan – Imaging can help to determine whether the there is increased ICP or 

not. This can be done by observing the arteries, ventricles and brain tissue on T1 

weighted images.

The solution should be able to accurately and continuously monitor ICP, without any significant 

risk factors such as infection.

","3. PARKINSON’S DISEASE 

BACKGROUND 

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease which affects the motor system over a 

period of several years and even decades. Parkinson disease (PD) is one of the most common 

neurologic disorders, affecting approximately 1% of individuals older than 60 years and causing 

progressive disability 

that 

can be 

slowed but not halted, by 

treatment. The 2 major 

neuropathologic findings in Parkinson disease are a loss of pigmented dopaminergic neurons of 

the substantia nigra pars compacta and the presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. 

Common symptoms include shaking (tremors), rigidity, slowness of movement and difficulty 

walking. India has an annual incidence rate of at least 1 lakh new cases 1. 

The 

incidence of Parkinson disease has been estimated to be 4.5-21 cases per 100,000 

population per year, and estimates of prevalence range from 18 to 328 cases per 100,000 

population, with most studies yielding a prevalence of approximately 120 cases per 100,000 

population. The incidence and prevalence of Parkinson disease increase with age. Onset in 

persons younger than 40 years is relatively uncommon. Parkinson disease is about 1.5 times 

more common in men than in women. 1 

Before the introduction of levodopa, Parkinson disease caused severe disability or death in 25% 

of patients within 5 years of onset, 65% within 10 years, and 89% within 15 years. The 

mortality rate from Parkinson disease was 3 times that of the general population matched for 

age, sex, and racial origin. With the introduction of levodopa, the mortality rate dropped 

approximately 50%, and longevity was extended by many years. This is thought to be due to the 

symptomatic effects of levodopa, as no clear evidence suggests that levodopa stems from the 

progressive nature of the disease. 1 

OBSERVATION 

Presentation 

A 71-year-old female came into the Neurology OPD of a tertiary care hospital with complaints of 

progressive muscle rigidity, especially in the joints over the past 1-2 years, along with mild 

postural instability. The family also informed doctors that the patient had occasional episodes of 

mild shaking of the left wrist when kept at rest. 

History 

The patient had no history of stroke, seizures or brain tumor. The patient had no history o f 

hypertension, Diabetes or high cholesterol. The patient had no other comorbidities. 

Treatment 

The neurologist asked for a brain and spine MRI which was completely normal. Erythrocyte 

Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and autoimmune panel - all came normal. A 

complete neurological examination was done and doctors noticed significant slowness

(MoCA) score was 23/30, which was indicative of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Doctors 

were unsure whether this was an early onset case of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Parkinson’s 

Disease (PD) or Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). Based on the occasional tremors in the 

left wrist, the doctors assumed a diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease and started the patient on 

Levodopa and Carbidopa. The patient was advised to go for frequent walks and solve puzzles 

and play games to improve physical movement as well as cognitive function. 

The patient was regularly followed up every month for 1 year. During this period, the family 

reported periodic 

improvements and deterioration of the patient. The patient was often 

nauseous, vomited every alternate day and felt dizzy when getting up from the bed. The doctor 

informed the patient's family that these were the side-effects of the medication. Patient's family 

requested the doctor not to increase the dose of L-dopa due to the side-effects. By then, the 

doctors had a confirmed diagnosis of PD due to the increase in wrist shaking at rest. Doctor's 

offered surgery as an option wherein a Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) device would be 

implanted into the brain of the patient and would reduce the patient's Parkinson's symptoms. 

However, the device and surgery were priced at INR.15 lakhs, which the patient's family could 

not afford. 

After 3 years, the doctors are still managing the patient on medication (L-dopa and Dopamine 

agonists). The tremors have increased severely. The patient can barely stand for one minute due 

to severe pain caused by the rigidity in the waist and knee joints. The patient’s family had to be 

with her at all times to prevent a fall.  

THE PROBLEM 

There is no affordable solution that stops or significantly reduces the rate of degeneration 

caused by PD. DBS is the only solution that manages the symptoms by sending electrical pulses 

to certain regions in the brain. However, this solution is expensive and unaffordable to most 

Indians. Most medications do not have significant improvement of the symptoms. L-dopa dose 

needs to be increased periodically to maintain the same the effect. 

A common problem with all long-term medication, including those for treatment of Parkinson’s 

Disease, is that the strength of the dosage needs to be progressively increased with time for the 

same or increased efficiency. Most common cause for this is the development of the body's 

immunity to the same. The side effects of these medications also increase progressively with 

increase in dosage. Beyond a certain point, the benefits of the medication are less than the 

degree of side effects and hence, the dosage has to be saturated. Heavy medication almost 

invariably puts a heavy load on the kidneys and liver. Liver Function Tests (LFTs) and Renal 

Function Tests (RFTs) need to be periodically done to ensure that medication is not taking its 

toll on the patient. The side effects of prolonged Levo-dopa treatment are well known in 

Parkinson’s Disease. Dyskinesia is the key side effect seen in PD patients on L-dopa medication. 

Many times, the treatment needs to be tapered down to prevent the severe movement 

disabilities introduced in PD patients.

MARKET POTENTIAL 

More than 1 lakh annual incidence rate of Parkinson ’s disease in India. Nearly 1 million people 

in India are currently living with PD. 2 

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE  

Treatment of Parkinson’s Disease primarily lies around management with medication and 

palliative care. Although L-dopa has it’s side-effects and is not entirely effective, this is the most 

affordable and widely accepted solution. There is no cure for any neurodegenerat ive disease as 

of today. Most of the solutions are aim at delaying the progression of the disease. L-dopa has 

episodic positive and negative effects on the patients. 3 

AVAILABLE OPTIONS FOR PARKINSON’S DISEASE 

● 

Levodopa and Dopamine agonists – Most of PD symptoms are due to deficiency of 

Dopamine 

in the Basal Ganglia region of the brain. Hence, medication is given to 

increase dopamine levels in the brain. Due to the blood-brain barrier, a significant dose 

of L-dopa needs to be taken to have a mild effect in the brain. High levels of L-dopa in 

the blood causes all the side-effects associated with L-dopa medication.   

● 

Other Medication – COMT Inhibitors, MAO-B Inhibitors and anticholinergics do not 

have strong evidence supporting 

their use 

in 

the 

treatment of motor symptoms 

accompanying PD. 

● 

Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) – This is an implant is placed in the brain via surgery 

and stimulates the Thalamus, Globus Pallidus or subthalamic nucleus depending on the 

motor symptoms observed. The device is then calibrated wirelessly from outside. The 

device costs 

INR.15 

lakhs 

including 

the surgery. Subsequent 

follow-ups and re-

calibrations add to the cost.   

● 

Functional Stereotactic Lesioning Surgery – This 

is a minimally 

invasive brain 

surgery which involves creating lesions using a 3D geometrical pin-pointing technology.

","4. PRESSURE ULCERS IN STROKE PATIENTS 

BACKGROUND 

Stroke is a severe disabling disease affecting millions in India annually. Stroke is becoming an 

important cause of premature death and disability in low-income and middle-income countries 

like India, largely driven by demographic changes and enhanced by the increasing prevalence of 

the key modifiable risk factors. As a result developing countries are exposed to a double burden 

of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. The poor are increasingly affected by 

stroke, because of both the changing population exposures to risk factors and, most tragically, 

not being able to afford the high cost of stroke care. Majority of stroke survivors continue to live 

with disabilities, and 

the costs of on-going rehabilitation and 

long-term-care are 

largely 

undertaken by family members, which impoverish their families. Elderly patients affected with 

stroke takes significantly longer to recover from the paralysis. In the process, these patients 

develop several secondary disabilities such as Osteopenia/Osteoporosis, Deep Vein Thrombosis 

(DVT), Clinical Depression, Edema etc. 1 

Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in India. The estimated adjusted 

prevalence rate of stroke range, 84-262/100,000 in rural and 334-424/100,000 in urban areas. 

The incidence rate is 119-145/100,000 based on the recent population-based studies. There is 

also a wide variation in case fatality rates with the highest being 42% in Kolkata. Stroke units 

are predominantly available in urban areas that too in private hospitals. Intravenous and intra-

arterial thrombolysis is commonly used in India. 2 

Although the terms decubitus ulcer, pressure sore, and pressure ulcer have often been used 

interchangeably, the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) currently considers 

pressure injury the best term to use, given that open ulceration does not always occur. A 

pressure ulcer is localized damage to the skin and underlying soft tissue, usually over a bony 

prominence or related to a medical or other device. It can present as intact skin or an open ulcer 

and may be painful. It occurs as a result of intense or prolonged pressure or pressure in 

combination with shear. 

OBSERVATION 

Presentation 

An 81-year-old female was brought into the emergency ward of a Tertiary care hospita l with 

left-sided hemiparesis and complete paralysis of the right hand. The patient had developed 

aphasia with a deviation of the mouth to the right. She also had severe difficulty in breathing. 

The family reported that they noticed the gradual difficulty in speech 4 days before. 

History 

The patient was a known case of Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 for 15 years. She was on medication 

for the same and her Blood Sugar was under control. 

8/23/18

","Treatment 

Immediate MRI-scan in the emergency ward revealed large areas of ischemic hypoxia in the left 

and right frontal-parietal regions. The patient was put on Levipil and rushed to the ICU, where 

she was put on a ventilator. She was in ICU for two weeks, during which she developed 

Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP).  She was put on antibiotics for the same and recovered 

from the same. Her respiratory effort improved and was extubated. She was still aphasic. 

During her recovery over 6-7 weeks in the regular ward, the patient has several emotional 

outbreaks. Psychiatry was consulted and she was put on antidepressants. The patient developed 

bedsores and was treated with wound care and medication for the same. 

The patient was put on calcium and Vit. D3 to prevent osteopenia. The patient was also put on 

DVT prophylaxis (antithrombotic drugs and stockings). Patient's physiotherapy sessions were 

very poor as she showed little to no effort. A full-time trained attender was employed to take 

care of the patient.  

The nursing bundle was followed with turning every few hours but the patient developed a 

pressure ulcer at the coccyx. The patient was kept on her side and the mattress was exchanged 

with a water bed. The ulcer grew larger despite the daily dressing and debridement and the 

patient could not afford the vaccum or hydrogel dressings.  

The daily dressing continued for the 10 weeks of admission in the hospital with minimal 

improvement in the ulcer bed after which the patient was discharged and advised to get daily 

dressing done at the local clinic 

THE PROBLEM 

Due to the aging process, recovery from stroke in the elderly is significantly slower. Doctors rely 

on the family, physiotherapists and speech therapists to help the patient 

in creating the 

enthusiasm and will 

to perform rehabilitation 

tasks. Patients 

frequently go 

into clinica l 

depression. Doctors frequently say that an incentivized and quantifiable rehabilitation system 

which gives feedback to the patient about his/her progress can go a long way to speed up the 

rehabilitation process. Majority of stroke survivors continue to live with disabilities, and the 

costs of on-going rehabilitation and long-term-care are largely undertaken by family members, 

which impoverish their families. 

Pressure is exerted on the skin, soft tissue, muscle, and bone by the weight of an individual 

against a surface beneath. These pressures often exceed capillary filling pressure (~32 mm Hg). 

In patients with normal sensitivity, mobility, and mental faculty, pressure injuries do not occur. 

Feedback, conscious and unconscious, from the areas of compression leads them to change their 

body position, and these changes shift the pressure before any irreversible tissue damage 

develops. It is often seen in bedridden patients can is very difficult to manage. It can result in 

complications like malignant transformation, autonomic dysreflexia, osteomyelitis and sepsis.

","5. DELAYED CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA (DCI) 

BACKGROUND 

The 

term 

subarachnoid hemorrhage 

(SAH) 

refers 

to 

extravasation of blood 

into 

the 

subarachnoid space between the pial and arachnoid membranes which surround the brain. 

Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) is a medical emergency in which there is bleeding into the 

subarachnoid space of the brain, often causing what is described as the most painful thumping 

headache in a person’s life. t occurs in various clinical contexts, the most common being head 

trauma. However, the familiar use of the term SAH refers to nontraumatic (or spontaneous) 

hemorrhage, which usually occurs 

in 

the 

setting of a 

ruptured 

cerebral aneurysm or 

arteriovenous malformation (AVM). This 

is commonly 

followed by 

increased 

intracranial 

pressure leading to the patient losing consciousness gradually. One of the most common causes 

of Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a ruptured intracerebral artery aneurysm. An aneurysm is a 

blood-filled bulge in the lining of the arterial wall. Atherosclerosis, infection (most commonly 

Syphilis) and congenital etiology are the most common causes of an aneurysm. This occurs most 

commonly due to the weakening tone of the arterial wall. This requires emergency surgery to 

decompress the cranium and prevent 

further bleeding. Delayed Cerebral Vasospasm 

is a 

common complication post-surgery 

in which cerebral arteries constrict 

leading to severe 

cerebral ischemia and often death 1. Vasospasm occurs in nearly 50% of all SAH patients post 

decompression. Delayed Cerebral Ischemia typically starts on Post-op Day 2-3 (POD3) and peaks 

at POD5 - POD14. 1 

The frequency of ruptured and unruptured aneurysms has been estimated at 1-9% in different 

autopsy 

series, with 

a prevalence of unruptured 

aneurysms of 0.3-5%. Retrospective 

arteriographic studies show a prevalence of less than 1% with the limitation that some cases 

did not receive adequate evaluation and thus some aneurysms may have been missed. Annual 

incidence increases with age and probably is underestimated because death is attributed to 

other reasons that are not confirmed by autopsies. The annual incidence of aneurysma l SAH in 

the United States is 6-16 cases per 100,000 population, with approximately 30,000 episodes 

occurring each year. Unlike other subcategories of stroke, the 

incidence of SAH has not 

decreased over time. However, since 1970, population-based survival rates have improved. 1 

OBSERVATION 

Presentation 

A 55-year-old male came into the emergency department of a government tertiary care hospital 

with a sudden onset splitting headache. The patient was unconscious when he was brought into 

the emergency ward. Family informed that the patient had an unbearable headache, after which 

the patient started losing consciousness.

","Neither the patient nor the family has had a history of headaches or blackouts. The patient had a 

history of Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 for 10 years and was on medication (insulin) for the same. 

According to the family, the patient's blood sugar was under control. 

Treatment 

CT scan showed a massive aneurysm rupture in the basilar artery leading to a subarachnoid 

hemorrhage. The patient was immediately rushed for surgery to stop the source of the bleed 

and decompress the cranium. An aneurysm located at the basilar artery was coiled to prevent 

blood from entering the cavity. The patient was given Nimodipine (Calcium channel blocker) 

prophylactically in view of possible cerebral vasospasm. Post-op patient's Glasgow Coma Scale 

(GCS) was 12/15. The patient was started slowly on triple-H (Hypertension, Hypervolemia, and 

Hemodilution) therapy prophylactically along with continuation on Nimodipine. Patient’s GCS 

was 10-11/15 early on Post-op day 3 (POD3).  

The doctor said that there was no way to continuously monitor the cerebral arteries for 

vasospasm, so as to act only when vasospasm is observed. Prophylactically starting triple-H 

therapy along with Nimodipine without vasospasm has high risks of re-bleeding, hyponatremia, 

renal medullary washout, and cerebral edema. Hence, most of the time the doctors have to start 

triple-H therapy with Nimodipine only after vasospasm has begun. This requires continuous 

intensive monitoring.  

Due to dropping GCS, contrast Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) was done on POD3 and 

revealed bilateral Anterior and Middle Carotid Artery (ACA and MCA) vasospasm. Triple-H 

therapy was made more aggressive at the risk of re-bleeding. However, by POD4, patient’s GCS 

had reduced to 9/15. MRI done on POD4 evening revealed cerebral ischemia. The patient died 

on POD5 early morning before any surgical intervention could be planned. 

THE PROBLEM 

There is no way to continuously and accurately monitor major to medium intracranial artery 

perfusion. This leaves doctors delivering medication prophylactically, not knowing whether 

they are required and in what dose. Most of the prophylactic medication such as Calcium 

channel blockers and triple-H therapy have various side-effects. Nimodipine and triple-H 

therapy are often contraindicated in severely hypertensive patients. There have been cases of 

cerebral re-bleeds, Gastro-intestinal (GI) bleeds, cerebral edema and renal medullary washout 

due to calcium channel blockers and triple-H therapy. Most of the times, it is too late to plan for 

surgical 

intervention such as angioplasty due 

to severe 

ischemia 

leading 

to 

irreversible 

neurological deficits. More importantly, triple-H and Calcium Channel blockers have not clearly 

shown to be effective in preventing secondary ischemia, especially in patients with moderate to 

severe Subarachnoid Hemorrhage. Management of severe SAH cases 

is almost entirely 

prophylactic since most of such patient progress to DCI.  1

MARKET POTENTIAL  

More than 2 lakh annual cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in India. Nearly 50% of these 

cases develop severe Cerebral Vasospasm leading to Delayed Ischemic Neurological Deficits 

(DIND). 2,3,4,5 Hence, we have more than 1 lakh annual cases of SAH progressing to DCI of 

varying severity.  

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 

Diagnosis of vasospasm is done via Contrast MR Angiography. Calcium channel blockers and 

Triple-H therapy are primarily used to prevent vasospasm. A meta-analysis by Cochrane 

reviews has shown that there is no clear benefit in using these therapies to prevent DIND. Due 

to lack of continuous monitoring, angioplasty cannot be planned in advance. 

● 

Calcium Channel Blocker – Nimodipine is primarily used to induce vasodilation. This 

drug is given for up to 3 weeks post-op since vasospasms can occur even 2 weeks after 

the hemorrhage. Nimodipine is a short-acting drug and hence needs to administered 2-3 

times a day under constant monitoring 

for re-bleeds 6. Since these drugs 

induce 

systemic vasodilation, their dose needs to be closely monitored, especially in patients on 

antithrombotics and vasodilators. 

● 

Triple-H Therapy – Hypertension, Hypervolemia, and Hemodilution are 

induced 

through intravenous (IV) fluids to counter vasospasm. However, the hypertension is 

systemic and not local. There is a high risk of renal medullary washout. Hence, IV fluids 

need to need to be administered after closely monitoring kidney function 7. 

● 

Angioplasty surgery – If the vasospasm is detected early and is localized to a small 

length of the artery, angioplasty can be planned to allow for normal perfusion. However, 

most of the times vasospasm is caught late due to lack of continuous monitoring.

Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) - This scale is the most commonly used method in the 

assessment of consciousness. This indirectly gives an indication of Intracranial Pressure 

(ICP) and cerebral perfusion. However, it is poor in distinguishing the precise cause of 

decreased consciousness.   

● 

Intraventricular Catheter for ICP monitoring - This uses a pressure transducer 

inserted via a catheter in the lateral ventricles or third ventricle. When ICP increases, 

there is  

● 

Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound - This monitoring method uses ultrasound waves to 

monitor cerebral perfusion in arteries close to the cranium. However, deep-seated 

major arteries cannot be monitored effectively and accurately using this method. This 

method is, however, extremely useful due to its non-invasive nature and hence can be 

done 2-3 times a day, if required.  

● 

CT / MRI scan - Scans are normally asked for, only when symptoms start showing in the 

patient. Decreased GCS and increased ICP are common reasons for getting a CT/MRI  

scan. These scans are expensive, require the patient to be mobilized and also require the 

patient to be still during scans. This causes MRI scans to be a last resort. MRI scans are 

used only when other easily usable monitoring options are either unavailable, 

contraindicated or do not give the required diagnostic information.

BACKGROUND 

Epilepsy in children is a common condition affecting millions in India. Childhood epilepsy is 

defined as epileptic seizures of any type in children up to the age of 18 years of age. There are 

various causes of epilepsy in children such as preterm birth, uneventful and prolonged labor, 

maternal exposure to toxins, genetic and congenital causes, etc. More than 3 million children 

under the age of 18 years are epileptic. Several of these epileptic conditions do not have clear 

and definite treatment options. Most of the children respond to Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs). 

However, around 5-10% of childhood epilepsy patients are refractory to AEDs. This leads to the 

underlying disease to worsen, leading to cognitive decline, increase in frequency and severity of 

seizures and severe developmental retardation. Early and accurate diagnosis of the cause of 

epilepsy can significantly help doctors is pursuing the right course of treatment. 1 

OBSERVATION 

A 12-year-old boy comes to the Neurology OPD of a tertiary hospital with a history of increased 

frequency of seizures over the past 72 hours. Seizures involve clenching of the teeth, tonic 

posturing of the head and drooling of saliva from the mouth. 

History 

The boy is the youngest of four siblings. He was born of a non-consanguineous marriage. He was 

born at Full-term via normal vaginal delivery. Antenatal period of pregnancy was uneventful 

with infrequent checkups. The boy had bluish discoloration at birth. The baby was kept in 

intensive care for close monitoring. The baby had seizures from the 2nd day of birth. He was 

discharged 10 days after a period of no seizures. He had generalized yellowish discoloration 

which worsened over the next 15 days. His stools were white in color. The boy had decreased 

feeding and reduced cry. The patient was taken to a government tertiary care hospital where he 

was treated and followed up for one year. Seizure frequency was under control.   

The patient had delayed and abnormal development over the course of the first 2 years. At 18 

months of age, the patient was brought to the hospital with several episodes of seizures over the 

previous 48 hours. Seizure Semiology: Up rolling of the eyes, frothing at the mouth and 

generalized tonic-clonic movements. The patient was a given a dose of steroids over 3 months 

which stopped the seizures temporarily.   

At 4 years of age, the patient presented to the hospital with left hemiparesis, deviation of angle 

of the mouth. The patient recovered with treatment gradually over 4-5 months. The patient had 

decreased use of upper and lower limbs. 

Patient has been on valproate, Topiramate, and Clobazam since birth. Patient has responded 

well to corticosteroids previously when the frequency of seizures had increased to many 

episodes per day. 

The frequency of seizures has increased over the past 10 years. Initially (first 2 years), the boy 

had 1 seizure per month. For the next 5-6 years, the boy had 4 seizures per month. Currently,

has right eye ptosis, left lower limb hypertonia along with brisk Deep Tendon Reflexes (DTR) in 

the lower left limb with ankle jerks. The patient had Plantar extensor withdrawal with ataxic 

gait. The patient had multifocal myoclonic jerks in limbs.   

MRI revealed mild multi-focal cortical atrophy involving insular and peri-insular regions. There 

was a presence of ipsilateral ventricular enlargement. Presence of T2 hyperintensity or atrophy 

of the head of caudate nucleus. Unilateral cortical and caudate atrophy progressively worsening

THE PROBLEM 

A large number of children with Rasmussen’s Encephalitis (RE), Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome 

(LGS) and some 

form of Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalitis (HIE) sequelae are refractory 

to 

antiepileptic drugs 

(AEDs). Most 

commonly used AEDs 

include valproate, 

lamotrigine, 

topiramate, benzodiazepines and rufinamide. Patients with RE progressively worsen with a 

severe reduction 

in cognitive function. MRI generally 

indicates hemispheric atrophy with 

inflammation. There 

is no way to definitive way to cure RE, LGS or HIE sequelae. Early 

management with AEDs, 

corticosteroids 

and 

immuno-active 

agents 

does 

not 

always 

significantly improve neurological deficits. 

Neurologists' precise diagnosis and cause of childhood epilepsy is based on MRI scans, blood 

workup, and neurological examination. Various conclusions can be drawn from these, leading to 

a diagnosis which does not point to a concrete etiology.  

NEED STATEMENT 

A long-term and definitive (compared to antiepileptic drugs and corticosteroids) way to treat 

epilepsy (Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalitis sequelae, Lennox Gastaut Syndrome and Rasmussen 

Encephalitis) 

in children at Tertiary care centers to prevent hemispheric atrophy, severe 

cognitive decline, and severe generalized morbidity

MARKET POTENTIAL 

More than 3 million children in India are epileptic. More than 3 lakhs of these children are 

refractory to medication and often require drastic surgical intervention, introducing severe 

morbidity. 2,3 

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 

Various types of Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs) are the standard of care for children with epilepsy. 

Several devices are available which alert the family and relatives of the child during a seizure so 

that the child can be attended to immediately. In patients who are refractory to standard AEDs, 

stronger anticonvulsant medications are used. These medicines have moderate to severe 

temporary side-effects. In cases where medication has no effect at all, surgery is the last resort. 

Hippocampal resection, Corpus Callostomy and cerebral hemispherectomy are most common 

surgeries resorted to.  

● 

Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AED) – Various AEDs are given depending on the type and 

severity of the epileptic seizure to prevent further episodes. Several patients have 

seizures in spite of being on AEDs. A fraction of them go into status epilepticus and need 

to be intubated after sedating them. 

● 

Steroids – Steroids are often used as a first-line treatment in children with seizures 

accompanied by encephalitis. This is done to suppress the inflammatory response. 

Tacrolimus is also occasionally used although there is no evidence supporting its use in 

childhood epileptic encephalitis.  

● 

Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) - Some studies have shown IVIG to reduce the 

frequency and severity of seizures. However, a Cochrane review classified these studies 

as highly biased and still claims that there is no clear unbiased Randomised Control 

Trial (RCT) evidence for IVIG in the treatment of refractory epilepsy 5.  

● 

Sedation and Intubation – In case the patients progress to Status Epilepticus (SE), the 

patients are sedated and intubated till the electrical activity in the brain stops (as seen 

on EEG).  

● 

Neurostimulation – In patients where surgery is contraindicated, neurostimulation 

may be used. Vagus nerve stimulation, anterior thalamic stimulation and closed-loop 

responsive stimulation are the common neurostimulation procedures. 4 

● 

Surgery – Brain resection surgery 

is a 

last resort when drugs do not show any 

improvement. Surgery introduces permanent disability due to removal or disconnection 

of parts of the brain. Hemispherectomy or corpus callostomy are the two common 

surgery options used in cases of refractory epileptic seizures. 

IDEAL SOLUTION STATEMENT 

The solution should be able to prevent seizures. In addition, the solution should prevent brain 

atrophy and cognitive decline. The child’s overall development should be unhampered and 

progress at a normal rate.

","7. TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY 

BACKGROUND 

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a nondegenerative, noncongenital insult to the brain from an 

external mechanical force, possibly leading to permanent or temporary impairment of cognitive, 

physical, and psychosocial 

functions, with an associated diminished or altered state of 

consciousness. TBI is a major cause of death and severe morbidity in all countries. Fall from 

heights and Road Traffic Accidents (RTA) are the leading causes of TBI. 1 

The definition of TBI has not been consistent and tends to vary according to specialties and 

circumstances. Often, the term brain injury is used synonymously with head injury, which may 

not be associated with neurologic deficits. The definition also has been problematic with 

variations in inclusion criteria. Inconsistency in the definition and classification of traumatic 

brain injury (TBI), along with discrepancies in data collection, has made the epidemiology of 

TBI difficult to describe accurately. Problems with TBI data collection include the fact many 

patients with mild TBI may not present to the hospital, and the ones who do present may be 

discharged at the emergency department (ED) without adequate documentation. Severe TBI 

with associated death at the scene of the accident or during transport to a hospital also may not 

be accounted for completely in data collection for TBI epidemiologic studies. 

Differences in diagnostic tools and admission criteria also may affect the above-defined severity 

classifications. In the past, the use of roentgenograms to help diagnose skull fractures after head 

injury did not show much of any concurrent intracranial lesions. These lesions were difficult to 

diagnose until the advent of CT scanning, which is now the diagnostic imaging of choice in TBI 

cases. 1 

OBSERVATION 

53 year-old-male was brought into the emergency ward of a tertiary government hospital after 

encountering a Road Traffic Accident. Patient’s GCS was 8 (E2V2M4) with no visible open injury 

or bleeding. Patient’s eyes were barely reactive to light. 

History 

The patient had a history of Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 for the past 6 years and was on medication 

for the same. No history of smoking or alcohol consumption. No other comorbidities. 

Treatment 

Immediate CT-scan in the emergency ward revealed a midline shift with a severe subdural 

hemorrhage. The patient was started on Mannitol and immediately rushed to emergency OT for 

Decompressive Craniectomy.  

Patient's GCS post-op was 11/15. Post-op CRASH prognostic tool for TBI patients indicated that 

there was more than a 40% chance that the patient would not survive post op due to petechial 

bleeds, midline shift, and low GCS.

Need Specification Documents – Neurology and Neurosurgery 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
","Patient's GCS progressively dropped from 11 to 7 over the next 4 days. There was increased 

Intracranial Pressure (ICP) as measured from the intraventricular catheter. There was severe 

brain inflammation. The doctor said GCS dropped due to secondary hypoxic insult caused by 

extensive inflammation. All the doctor could do was administer mannitol and nimodipine to 

manage edema and prevent vasospasm respectively. The patient died Post-op day 6 due to 

severe brain hypoxia.  

THE PROBLEM 

There is very little that doctors can do in the acute stage (days immediately post-op) after 

Decompressive Craniectomy in moderate to severe TBI patients. The brain inflammation needs 

to subside by itself as part of the healing process. ICP monitoring is an expensive affair and the 

intraventricular catheter needs to be changed frequently due to high risk of infection.

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 

TBI cases are always an emergency and early management can lead to better outcomes. As soon 

as the patient is taken to a THC, a GCS score is evaluated and CT-scan is done to look for 

intracranial hematomas. If there is significant intracranial bleeding, the patient is rushed for 

Decompression surgery. The patient is administered Mannitol to help reduce brain edema and 

hence 

ICP.

","frequently not available in government THCs) and need to be changed frequently (every 2 

weeks) due to the risk of infection. Most of the damage to the brain is done due to secondary 

injury. This happens due to hypoxia induced by increased ICP. Eventually, doctors have to wait 

and hope that the brain can withstand the ICP and heal in time. CT -scans may be required every 

2 days to monitor for any uncontrolled bleeding or fluid collection, which may be expensive or 

impossible (unavailability of CT-scan) in a government THC.  

● 

CT/MRI scan – This used to gauge the extent of damage done by the TBI. It helps the 

doctors plan a further course of action in terms of surgery and medication.  

● 

Decompressive Craniectomy (DC)– This is done to evacuate the hematoma, reduce 

ICP and allow the brain to expand due to inflammation. The cranium flap is stored in a 

sterile container at very low temperatures. DC does not always lower ICP to normal 

levels. If the inflammation and edema are too much, then ICP still remains elevated to a 

level that poses a risk for hypoxia. Continuous ICP monitoring is essential. 4 

● 

ICP Monitoring – Continuous ICP monitoring along with periodic GCS scores is the state 

of the art when it comes to the quick assessment of the patient's progress in the case of 

TBI. Higher ICP normally correlates with low GCS and vice-versa. When ICP is above 

threshold values, doctors initiate an action such as a CT/MRI for details as to why the 

ICP is high. This may be followed by a change of medication or surgery, as the case may 

be.  

● Medication – Mannitol 

is 

the standard drug used 

to 

treat cerebral edema and 

inflammation. Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs) are used when patients have seizures or are 

at high risk for the same.  

● 

Palliative Care – If the patient has managed to regain a GCS above 13, the patient is 

discharged, even though the patient is far from regaining full control of his/her body. 

Physiotherapy and speech therapy is an active part of helping the patient taking back 

control of his/her daily activities. A healthy diet and certain drugs can help this process 

● 

Therapeutic hypothermia: Also termed target temperature management (TTM), is the 

cornerstone of neuroprotective strategy. Dating to the pioneer works of Fay, nearly 

75 years of basic and 

clinical evidence 

support 

its 

therapeutic value. Although 

hypothermia decreases the metabolic rate to restore the supply and demand of O2, it has 

other tissue-specific effects, such as decreasing excitotoxicity, limiting inflammation, 

preventing ATP depletion, reducing 

free radical production and also 

intracellular 

calcium overload to avoid apoptosis. 4 

● 

Functional Electrical Stimulation: Promising results are coming from the use of 

functional electrical stimulation (FES). FES uses a computer and electrodes to give small 

bursts of electricity to paralyzed muscles. This is done to generate muscle contractions.  

Currently, FES is being used to try and restore function that was lost after a spinal cord 

injury. By stimulating paralyzed muscles, patients are experiencing improvement in 

hand movements, bladder and bowel control, and even potential for respiration without 

the use of a ventilator. Researchers are trying to advance this current system, which is 

showing promising results not only in spinal cord injuries, but for stroke patients as 

well. 5 

● 

Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI): Brain-computer interfaces bypass nerve cells that 

have been damaged from a spinal cord injury. These devices, when implanted, may 

restore control of voluntary muscle movement to paralyzed muscles. Because patients

patients with paralysis. The ability to restore any amount of function in a paralyzed 

patient is a huge step in the patient having some normalcy in their life after spinal cord 

injury. 5

","8. ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE 

BACKGROUND 

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that progressively worsens 

with time. AD is the most common form of dementia and begins after the age of 65 years. The 

disease is characterized by progressive memory loss, inability to recognize people and places, 

cognitive decline, and mood swings. In 2015, AD resulted in nearly 2 million deaths worldwide. 

AD invariably affects the family and caregivers, since the patient entirely depends on them for 

his/her day to day needs. There is no early and accurate way to diagnose or effective way to 

treat AD 1. It is an incurable disease with a long preclinical period and progressive course. In AD, 

plaques develop in the hippocampus, a structure deep 

in the brain that helps to encode 

memories, and in other areas of the cerebral cortex that are involved in thinking and making 

decisions.  

AD is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 3.6% of all deaths in 

2014. In the United States alone, approximately 6.08 million Americans had either a clinical AD 

or mild cognitive impairment due to AD in 2017. That number is expected to grow to 15 million 

by 2060. Economically, AD is a major public health problem. Total payments in 2017 for health 

care and long-term care for all individuals with AD or other dementias are estimated at $259 

billion. By 2050, these costs could rise as high as $1.1 trillion. 1 

OBSERVATION 

Presentation 

77 year-old-male was brought into OPD due to the slowness of movement (bradykinesia), and 

short-term memory loss that had been developing over the past 2 years. 

History 

The patient had no history of trauma or any other related comorbidity 

Treatment 

MRI scan was done which showed atrophy near the hippocampus and 

lateral ventricular 

enlargement, which are both classic signs of AD. The patient was diagnosed with mild to 

moderate AD. The patient was started on memantine (NMDA receptor antagonist) daily dose.  

There was little to no improvement over 2-3 years after which the patient started to deteriorate 

further. The patient was also put on Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. There was mild retardation 

in the rate of deterioration over one year, after which the patient started to deteriorate even 

faster. Over 7 years (84 years old), patient progressed to severe Alzheimer's Disease. The doctor 

wanted to start glutamate, but the disease had progressed to a point where no treatment would 

work. The patient failed to recognize people or places. He progressed from only being able to 

use phrases 

to being able 

to use words only. Most communication was

","expression. A full-time caregiver was employed to take care of the patient. The patient died at 

the age of 85 years due to Pneumonia. 

THE PROBLEM 

There is no solution to cure or manage (significantly delay the progression of the disease) of AD. 

The disease mechanism has not been understood completely, which hampers the way for 

effective solutions. The current standard of care is largely palliative with full-time trained 

people looking after the patient, especially when the disease has progressed to severe stages. 

A common problem with all 

long-term medication, 

including those 

for the treatment of 

Alzheimer’s Disease, is that the strength of the dosage needs to be progressively increased with 

time for the same or increased efficiency. Most common cause for this is the development of the 

body's immunity to the same. The side effects of these medications also increase progressively 

with increase in dosage. Beyond a certain point, the benefits of the medication are less than the 

degree of side effects and hence, the dosage has to be saturated. Heavy medication almost 

invariably puts a heavy load on the kidneys and liver. Liver Function Tests (LFTs) and Renal 

Function Tests (RFTs) need to be periodically done to ensure that medication is not taking its 

toll on the patient.

to 

the 

severe 

stage. Psychosocial 

intervention has 

shown no measurable

AVAILABLE OPTIONS 

Drugs have been the mainstay treatment for managing Alzheimer’s Disease. NMDA receptor 

antagonists and Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are the commonly used drugs. However, their 

effect is limited to when the disease is in the early to moderate stages. Even then, the effect is 

not often not significant to 

improve quality of 

life. Glutamate has been used to 

improve 

neurotransmitter function, but high risks of excitotoxicity leading to brain cell death exist. The 

side-effects of long-term use of these drugs means that there is still no clear and proven 

treatment for AD. 3, 4 

Recent advances:  

Deep brain stimulation: Scientists placed hair-thin electrodes 

into 

the brain 

to deliver 

electricity. The electricity delivery is designed to increase the activity of the nucleus basalis of 

Meynert, which is the area of the forebrain that is degenerated in Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s 

diseases. 5 

Rehabilitation Technology: Numerous devices are software are now available and being 

developed to help in the rehabilitation of patients with AD. So far they have had moderate 

success but do not help in halting/reversing the disease progression.  5 

Non-invasive brain stimulation: Using an MRI, scientists were able to determine where 

memory-related brain networks were 

located 

and 

stimulated 

them with non-invasive 

electromagnetic stimulation. The brain stimulation lasted 24 hours and correlated with brain 

activity changes. This non-invasive stimulation gives scientists a better understanding of 

memory improvement. Previous brain stimulation only lasted a short amount of time and have 

short-lived effects on thinking abilities. 5 

Brainwave oscillations: These technique are used to induce brainwave oscillations to treat 

Alzheimer’s disease symptoms. It is presently in the early stages of research and development 

and plans to start using the techniques that it has used in mouse models in humans. 5 

IDEAL SOLUTION STATEMENT 

The solution should be able to quantifiably improve Cognitive function over time as indicated by 

the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) or Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) tests.

","9. BRAIN TUMOR 

BACKGROUND 

A brain tumor is formed when abnormal cells grow rapidly inside the brain. When the tumor 

grows large enough in size, it leads to increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP)e. A decompressive 

craniotomy with tumor resection is the first line of treatment in reducing the ICP. However, 

most of the Indian population cannot afford a brain surgery in a private hospital , whereas 

government hospitals are overburdened with surgeries. India has around 1500 neurosurgeons, 

which does not meet India’s demand for neurosurgeons performing surgeries at economical 

prices for the vast majority of the country 1. 

OBSERVATION 

Presentation 

A 46-year-old male came into the OPD of a government tertiary care hospital after being 

referred from a Primary Healthcare Centre (PHC). His family brought him with mild impairment 

of speech and occasional inability to recognize people.  

History 

The patient had no other medical history or related comorbidity. 

Treatment 

The neurologist asked for an MRI which revealed a tumor in the parieto-occipital region of the 

brain. Surgery was planned for a month later due to unavailability of Neuro Operation theatre 

(OT) before a month. 

During the surgery, the surgeon could not resect all of the tumor due to i ts contacts with major 

arteries. Hence, the doctor resected as much as possible and said that the patient will have to be 

monitored for any re-growth of the tumor. Histopathology of the tumor was done and the tumor 

was reported to be a high-grade Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). The patient was followed up 

with IV chemotherapy for 6 months at the District Hospital which was 300 kilometers from his 

home. Government hospitals do not have newer non-invasive radiation surgery tools such as 

stereotactic radiation surgery, which helps in tumor resection in difficult to access places. 

The patient was advised to do an MRI every 4 months for the next 2 years to confirm that the 

tumor is not re-growing. The patient lived 800 kilometers from the THC but was willing to 

travel the distance for the free treatment. After 1 year of follow-up, the tumor was confirmed to 

be re-growing and hence required another surgery. However, the Neurosurgery OT was booked 

for the next several months with equally urgent surgeries. The Neurosurgery department 

maintains a priority list of which patients require surgery urgently. This patient was put down 

on the list for a surgery which was scheduled 6 months later. When the department called the 

patient 6 months later, the family informed that the patient had died.

","PROBLEM 

A tumor resection surgery via craniotomy costs up to 5 lakhs in a private hospital. Most of the 

rural population cannot afford such a surgery. Hence, they resort to government hospitals. 

Government hospitals are burdened with surgeries for 6 days 

in a week. Decompressive 

Craniotomy with tumor resection typically takes at least 5-6 hours and can go up to 24 hours 

depending on the complexity of the tumor. Hence, neurosurgery departments generally handle 

one such case per day. Most of the patients have to wait until it’s their turn for surgery. Many 

patients die during the wait. Chemotherapy 

is relatively 

ineffective 

in completely killing 

malignant primary tumors.

tumors in patients at tertiary care centres to avoid recurrences

MARKET POTENTIAL

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 

Most of the brain tumors present with neurological symptoms once the tumor has grown to a 

large enough size that chemotherapy and radiation therapy in themselves cannot completely 

kill all the tumor cells. Hence, surgery via craniotomy is the most common line of treatment. 

Chemotherapy and Radiation therapy is often used to get rid of tumor tissue that is unreachable 

in the brain. However, radiation therapy and chemotherapy have their own respective side-

effects. 

CURRENT TREATMENT 

● 

Surgery via Craniotomy – This involves removing a piece of the cranium by creating 

burr holes. The tumor is then resected. 4 

● 

Radiation surgery – Stereotactic radiosurgery involves sending high energy radiation 

from various directions to meet at a common point (location of the tumor). The joint 

radiation created high energy which is converted to heat and hence burns the tumor 

tissue. 5 

● 

Chemotherapy – Chemotherapeutic agents are delivered either orally or through an 

intravenous cannula. However, chemotherapy is rather ineffective in killing primary 

malignant tumors, which accounts for most of the high-grade brain tumors.

","10. SWALLOWING FUNCTION ASSESSMENT  

BACKGROUND 

Aspiration is defined as the inhalation of either oropharyngeal or gastric contents into the lower 

airways, that is, the act of taking foreign material into the lungs. This can cause a number of 

syndromes determined by the quantity and nature of the aspirated material, the frequency of 

aspiration, and the host factors that predispose the patient to aspiration and modify the 

response.  Almost all patients who develop aspiration pneumonia have one or more of the 

predisposing conditions such as alcoholism, drug overdose, seizures, stroke, head trauma, 

general anesthesia or intracranial mass lesion. 1 Several stroke patients lose control over 

swallowing function due to hypoxia in certain regions of the brain. During rehabilitation in the 

hospital, the patient’s swallowing function has to be repeatedly evaluated, until which, the 

patient is fed via a nasogastric tube. There is a high risk of the patient developing Aspiration 

Pneumonia (AP) when swallow tests are done using water fed through a tablespoon 1. Nearly 

30% of all stroke patients require swallow function tests. 1 Several studies suggest that 5-15% 

of the 4.5 million cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) result 

from aspiration 

pneumonia. A retrospective review 

found 

that 

the 30-day mortality rate 

from aspiration 

pneumonia is 21% overall and slightly higher in healthcare-associated aspiration pneumonia 

(29.7%).  

OBSERVATION 

Presentation 

A 67-year-old female was admitted to emergency with sudden onset weakness in left upper and 

lower limbs, along with deviation of mouth to the right. 

History 

The patient was a regular consumer of tobacco until 3 years ago. The patient had a history of a 

minor ischemic Cerebro-Vascular Accident (CVA) (acute pre-central gyrus infarct due to right 

middle cerebral artery block) 3 years ago. The patient was on anti-stroke medication and had an 

almost complete recovery in 6 months. She stopped her medication by herself after she had 

completely regained control over the affected skeletal muscles. 

Days of admission 

On 

the day of admission, 

the MRI 

revealed a 

frontal-parietal 

infarct along with mild 

compression of the right lateral ventricle. The patient was put on anti-stroke and anti-seizure 

medication. An Echocardiogram showed a sclerosed aortic valve along with aortic regurgitation. 

The left atrium was dilated. Doctors concluded that this was a cardio-embolic stroke. The 

patient was kept in the hospital to recover from the stroke.  

Three days later, she had a Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizure (GTCS) and patient progressed to 

status epilepticus. The patient was sedated and shifted to ICU, where she was intubated. A few

","days later the patient was shifted to a regular ward since there were no more episodes of 

seizures. The patient was on Nasogastric Tube for feeding. Doctors were unable to assess any 

improvement in the swallowing action of the patient. Doctors tried to give a teaspoon of water 

to assess swallowing. There was a high risk of aspirating the water into the lungs. Doctors said 

that many patients in the past have contracted pneumonia both before and after evaluation of 

swallowing via this crude method.  

THE PROBLEM 

Doctors do not have an affordable, portable and easy-to-use solution to assess swallowing 

functionality. A Functional Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) is an expensive and 

skilled solution that cannot be used on a daily basis. Hence, neurologists resort to giving a little 

water to drinking in a teaspoon. If the patient is able to receive the water well repeatedly, they 

proceed with soft food items. Patients who have not regained full control over swallowing end 

up having the water enter the lungs, which leads to infected lungs (Pneumonia/Pneumonitis). 

Currently available solutions to assess swallowing 

function are both expensive and non-

portable. 

NEED STATEMENT 

A quantifiable, portable and affordable way to assess swallowing 

function 

in post-stroke 

patients at Tertiary Healthcare Centres to avoid the high risk of aspiration pneumonitis / 

Pneumonia. 

FILTERING PROCESS 

Final Score = 13.5 

Rank = 10 

MARKET POTENTIAL 

There are 15 lakh new reported cases of stroke every year. 

Dysphagia occurs in 55% of all acute stroke patients. 

At least 20% of these cases are at high risk of developing Aspiration Pneumonia (AP): At least 3 

lakh cases of AP every year. 2

","COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE  

There is no portable and affordable technology that can accurately assess swallowing function. 

Due to the lack of technology, neurologists often resort to risky methods such as providing a 

measured quantity of water to drink. The doctor then manually observes the throat along with 

any cough or gag reflex that may be present. 

X-ray and endoscopy-based methods are available. However, they are not preferred to be used 

on a daily basis due to the cost of the scan and the immobility of the technology. Additionally, 

these technologies also have their own side-effects. 

AVAILABLE OPTIONS 

● 

Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) - This is an endoscope which 

helps to visualize the tongue and epiglottis and judge their functionality. Based on this, 

doctors decide on whether the patient is ready to start receiving food from the mouth. 

This requires a skilled doctor to both use the equipment as well as evaluate the 

swallowing function. Endoscopes are immobile devices and are expensive to the patient 

for daily usage on the same patient. 3 

● 

Barium Swallow Test – The patient is made to drink a Barium Sulphate solution while 

an x-ray video is captured. The Barium Sulphate absorbs x-ray radiation and hence 

shows up on an x-ray. The video clearly shows the movement of the liquid from the 

mouth to the stomach. Rear-tongue and epiglottis function is judged from this video. 

Patients may be allergic to Barium Sulphate and go into anaphylactic shock. Patients 

may also develop constipation. Long-term effects from the x-ray radiation include the 

high risk of cancer. 4 

● 

Toronto Bedside Swallowing Screening Test – This involves delivering 10 teaspoons 

of water to judge whether the patient has dysphagia or not. However, there is a high risk 

of the water aspirating into the lungs, hence inducing pneumonia. 5 

IDEAL SOLUTION STATEMENT 

The solution must be designed such that it can be used daily on the same patient bedside, 

without incurring much cost to the patient. The solution must be easy-to-use and should give a 

quantified assessment of swallowing function.
